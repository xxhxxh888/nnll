YMCA in South Australia
South Australia (SA)  has a unique position in Australia's history as, unlike the other states which were founded as colonies, South Australia began as a self governing province Many were attracted to this and Adelaide and SA developed as an independent and free thinking state.
The compound of philosophical radicalism, evangelical religion and self reliant ability typical of its founders had given an equalitarian flavour to South Australian thinking from the beginning.
It was into this social setting that in February 1850 a meeting was called primarily for the formation of an Association (apparently meaning a Y.M.C.A.)
for apprentices and others, after their day's work, to enjoy books, lectures, discussions, readings, friendly relief and recreation for a leisure hour.
In September 1850 records show that this became “The Young Men's Christian Association of South Australia" as evidenced by a member's letter in London Y.M.C.A.
Report 1851.
There was no census in 1850 but the 1851 census put the total population of South Australia at 63,700 with males numbering 35,302.
The discovery of Gold in Ballarat caused a large migration from South Australia and by 1852 some 8000 had left for the Goldfields.
As a consequence the various YMCA groups that had become established failed and by 1870 none remained.
"The next available authentic record of an Association in South Australia does not appear until some members of London Y.M.C.A.
coming to Adelaide, joined with ex members of the defunct original Adelaide Branch, and also members of the Brompton Association.
A meeting of promoters was also held at Presbyterian Church.
They became associated in the Exchange Room of the Adelaide Town Hall on November 28th, 1878 at a public meeting for the promotion of a revival of the Y.M.C.A.
in Adelaide.
Sir John Colton (a member of the Adelaide Association in 1853 and a founder of Prince Alfred College) had been asked to preside, but was absent through illness and the chair was occupied by Mr. Richard Searle ( a managing partner of D & W Murray and Co ) who became the first President of the Association.
A committee was formed to draft a constitution, later drawn up and signed by 585 Adelaide young men."
Since that time the YMCA has operated continuously, been part of the fabric of the state and  served the community of South Australia
Leading the YMCA was regarded as a calling and attracted men of compassion and social conscience.
Not known as chief executive officers until the 1990s, they were known as General Secretaries.
With the YMCA of Adelaide one of the very early organisations for social good it attracted some of the state's leading influential figures to its board and men of high calibre as General Secretary.
The history of the organisation in South Australia is very much tied to the leadership by both General Secretaries (CEOs) and the presidents along with the boards who backed them.
1879 - H.H.
Birt.
appointed by the board on a part-time basis.
Birt oversaw activities in the temporary premises, Salisbury Chambers in king William Street and to manage the alteration of the newly leased premises in Gawler Place which opened 27 August 1879.
1880 -1886 Alex A Walker.
Walker was secretary of the Flinders Street Presbyterian Men's Society which merged into the YMCA with him continuing as General Secretary.
In 1886 the annual report of the YMCA indicated a lack of funds and Walker confessed to having appropriated £1288/16/7.
In court and before Chief Justice Sir Samuel Way, Walker revealed the money had gone on assisting impecunious young men.
Walker was regarded as a very hard working Secretary who said he did not have a night off in any month and the board believed he did not have fraudulent intent but compassion rather than criminality.
He was sent to jail for 4 years hard labour.
1886 - 1900 John James Virgo.
The 'new' YMCA building in Gawler Place was opened in 1884 and in 1886 the Glenelg born Virgo was appointed General Secretary following the conviction of the previous General Secretary for embezzling funds.
In 1888 the YMCA began Our Boys Institute for work among boys 13 to 18 years of age.
For young men, activities included Bible classes, sporting teams, lectures, debating and choral societies, a gymnasium, camps and an employment and immigration department.
Virgo was prominent in Adelaide's religious life and conducted evangelistic services on Sunday evenings at the Theatre Royal in Hindley Street.1900 Virgo became secretary of the Australasian Union of Y.M.C.A.s and 1903 was appointed secretary of the Y.M.C.A., Sydney then General Secretary of the London Central Y.M.C.A.
in 1911.
Virgo wrote his memoirs in 1939.
He died in 1956.
1905 - 1916 H.A Wheeler.
Wheeler was a capable administrator who adapted the programmes and emphasis to the times.
Much of the evangelical work was dropped to focus on the work with young men.
In 1908 Wheeler left for two years to work with the YMCA in America.
This forged a link with North American YMCA's and more modern methods of physical development and a rapid development of membership.
An employment department was formed in 1912 fulfilling an important social welfare role especially for young male migrants.
At the outbreak of WW1 Wheeler took the initiative in promoting a nation-wide War Services Y.M.C.A.
organisation and later was placed in charge of all Australian War Services in the European Zone.
WW1 saw the Adelaide YMCA support YMCA staff overseas as evidenced by a letter to Wheeler from Menza camp Egypt by Col S Price Weir OC 10th battalion.
by1916 The army Department was the largest work done by the Adelaide YMCA with operations at Mitcham, Cheltenham, Balaklava, Murray Bridge, Torrens Island, Gawler.
The YMCA provided comfort, counselling and recreation to the troops.
YMCA war services were funded by public donation and during this time in South Australia ₤199,185 was raised.
1908 -1910 - H.S.
Stafford acting General Secretary.
Stafford, an American from Dayton Ohio was working at the Bendigo YMCA and took the acting role while Wheeler spent 2 years working for the YMCA in the United States His work transformed the organisation as recognised in a speech by the then President Henry J Holden who said of him.
".. it was not an association of Christian young men but a Christian association for all young men"
1916 -1920 The title of General Secretary was discontinued this period as post war the organisation needed to adjust having been dominated by the military units.
Two officers controlled the organisation.
M.U.
Maddern was secretary to the Army Department and R Taylor became Secretary of the General Department.
This gave lack of continuity at the top at a time when the planning for transition to peace time was so important.
1920 Jack Tolston Massey.
Jack Massey began his YMCA career as a field secretary attached to the Australian Imperial Forces A Christian (Anglican) and a pacifist he served in England France and Belgium assisting soldiers awaiting repatriation.
He was appointed as General Secretary of the Adelaide YMCA in 1920 and went on to build and expand the organisation as well as develop programmes and advocate for young people with accomplishments including establishing a court for juvenile offenders and guiding amateur football in SA.
He also provided support for British Boys brought out to help in agriculture.
He attended the 100 years of Adelaide YMCA in 1978 not long before his death in 1981 and was acclaimed as one of the great men of the organisation and the community for his life of service.
1939 - 1960 Alf Gibbs .
During WW1 Alf Gibbs served as YMCA War Services Department Chief Commissioner overseeing YMCA staff in almost all military camps and some 62 representative overseas to assist the troops.
Gibbs was appointed General Secretary Adelaide YMCA after some negotiations with the Adelaide YMCA Board while Alf was in India.
He oversaw the expansion of the YMCA and the sale of the Gawler Place building.
In 1956 he negotiated the purchase of the Presbyterian Church in Flinders Street which was demolished the following year and a new modern YMCA youth complex and residential facility was constructed.
Gibbs led the fundraising that enabled the construction of YMCA youth facilities at Walkerville, Kilburn, Elizabeth and Glenelg.

1960s
Graeme Irvine.
Irvine was an evangelical Christian and developed in the Adelaide YMCA a group of similar thinking leaders.
Ultimately this became exclusive and counterproductive.
He went on to build up World Vision Australia and then to New York where he grew the organisation into a large multinational NGO.
Irvine was in 1978 among the signers of the "Declaration of Internationalization", which declared a set of objectives for World Vision in its operations throughout the world.
In 1988, Irvine became the first non-American president of World Vision International.

Other initiatives included Dollar Day a door knocking fundraiser and the City Port Fun Run which attracted thousands of runners.
1980s
Trevor Cleland.

Clive Armour (CEO of ETSA) Colin Williamson (CEO of Strategic Resources Consulting).
A restructure of the organisation and shaking off the old Methodist mentality about paying people for their 'calling'.

Dowling came from Carclew Performing Arts and became our first leaders called a CEO as the others were titled General Secretaries.
Dowling was a transformational leader and kept all the Y programmes running at a high level and established a Registered Training Organisation running certificate course out of the Flinders Street headquarters.
With the Flinders Street property becoming outdated and run down Dowling sought to redevelop site.. A 12-story, strata titled building with the Y having some floors and selling off others.
Plans were drawn by Woodhead Australia and funding partners sought.
Brilliant idea but the board was not able to pull it off.
The Flinders' Street property was then sold as cost of fire compliance and the age of the building proved uneconomical to refurbish.
Closing the residential wing affected the organisations cash flow.
Dowling sought to purchase another building, an old bank, but not supported by the Board.
Dowling left to undertake teaching and research at Flinders University before retirement to the Adelaide hills.
Dave Bedson: Held the position for a short time.
2000s
Mike Kelly.
Driven by the board policy Kelly spent his time trying to win contracts for student accommodation which was an emerging area of service due to the growing numbers of overseas students in Adelaide.
This chewed up significant funds which ultimately delivered no results and the money from the sale of Flinders Street property began to diminish.
Changing time saw the diminishing of the camping programme and Explorers and Adventurers.

Lucas (Charley Palmer Rothwell) and Chloé (Roxane Mesquida) are a former dysfunctional couple who, after having spent a year apart, meet again because Chloé decides to invite him to play a game called Paranoia, in which they offer a million euros to the two players who finish the game.
By gathering the clues to be accepted in the game they arrive at a party, where they find a way to reach an abandoned hospital where the game will take place.
Upon arrival a mysterious voice tells all the players the rules of the game and how to play, but what the mysterious voice does not tell the players is that the main rules of the game are: Number 1: Nothing is real, and Number 2 : One of you will die.
When starting the game Lucas begins to notice that something was not normal and that in the game they were only trying to kill all the players, but Chloé refuses to believe that anyone wants to kill them all.
Minutes after having passed the first test of the game, in the second test of the game they run into the corpse of one of the players, so both begin to worry and get scared.
Frightened by what happened, Chloé and Lucas just try to finish the game to save their lives, and later in a room they find another corpse of another player and some papers where there was information about Naomi (Marie Zabukovec), who was actually admitted to the hospital abandoned years ago, and she was a totally dangerous patient.
So Chloé deduces that she is the murderer.
After having passed some tests of the game, they reach the final test, which makes them go to the abandoned hospital church, that's where Chloé discovers that Lucas is really the murderer and that he is a psychopath who suffers from memory loss.
From what Chloé makes him believe that they are about to reach the end of the game, when she finds a ladder to go up to the second floor of the church, she decides pushing Lucas from the stairs and she flees the place, but he manages to find her and kill her.
While he is unaware of what he was doing, he thinks he has found the murderer who killed all the players in the game, but the murderer is really himself, and that is where it is discovered that he murdered his mother and that he organized everything the game.

Kazakh playing cards
Kazakh playing cards ("Qazaq Deck") are a deck of 54 cards used in Kazakhstan and other countries for playing Kazakh national playing card games.
The deck allows people, especially foreigners, to become acquainted with the rich world of cultural traditions and customs of the Kazakhs.
Kazakh playing cards differ from the classic French deck in that it has unique non-standard suits, i.e.
Horse, Apple, Eagle, and Tulip.
In other words, there is no division into classes such as: clubs representing the peasantry; diamonds, the merchant class; hearts, the clergy; spades, the warrior class.
Alternatively, the Kazakh suits are divided into the so-called Yurts ("jurttar") that represent the different ways relatives are connected to a person.
There are four traditional Yurts: Óz Yurt symbolizing relatives on father’s side; Naǵashy Yurt, relatives on mother’s side; Qaıyn Yurt, relatives on spouse’s side; and Quda Yurt, the ones obtained through children’s marriage.
Within the Yurts, there is a hierarchy of relatives that sets a one-of-a-kind system of kinship.
The Yurts lay the foundation for the whole philosophy of family relationships to which nomadic societies have always attached significant importance.
It is not accidental that the Kazakh card suits have such widely recognized symbols.
Horse, apple, eagle, and tulip are the key cultural and civilizational symbols of the Kazakhss and many other Turkic peoples.
Scientific facts clearly identify the territory of modern Central Asia as the home of the very first domesticated horses, as well as falcons and eagles firstly trained for hunting.
It is also widely acknowledged that the fertile lands of Central Asia gave birth to modern apples and tulips.
Jeanette Wilson
Jeanette Wilson is a professional medium and spiritual healer who claims to heal people with the assistance of spirits.
Wilson has also promoted anti-vaccination and anti-5G views.
During a tour of the United Kingdom, several venues cancelled her appearances over concerns that her presentation could discourage people from seeking needed medical care or vaccinating their children.
Wilson was born in the United Kingdom in 1963.
She worked as a bank manager until she began working as a psychic healer and medium, following the death of her grandfather, who she claims contacted her after his death.
She moved from the UK to New Zealand in 1999.
Wilson has said that she is able to communicate with several spirits, including at least one deceased surgeon, who help her to conduct spiritual healing.
Her sessions include waving her hands, which she states are possessed by spirits, while humming, stomping, and clapping.
Wilson has stated that her psychic healing abilities include curing arthritis and the healing of vision impairments that require glasses.
She has also stated that she has treated paralysis, blindness in one eye, and many cases of life-threatening cancer.
Wilson has said she never discourages her clients from seeking medical care, however she has publicly discouraged her followers from seeking medical screening for breast cancer, stating "I’m not convinced about mammograms.
I’ve had one myself but personally I wouldn’t have another one.
That isn’t me telling you not to have them, but I know what it does to me and my body.”
Wilson describes accused serial sex abuser and debunked faith healer João Teixeira de Faria, AKA John of God, as a mentor and has said that they are both assisted in psychic healing by some of the same spirits.
She describes her claimed psychic abilities in the context of her Christianity, stating that they are a gift from God.
She has stated that her psychic sessions always include the Lord's Prayer and the Hail Mary.
In 2004, Wilson was the subject of a New Zealand Channel Three television series titled "Dare to Believe".
Later, she was featured on an episode of 20/20.
She has written four books about her experiences as a professional medium and about other new age topics.
In addition to conducting private consultations, Wilson has held public events in places such as the UK and New Zealand.
Wilson has spread anti-vaccine messages, including a claim that vaccines are linked to Alzheimer's disease.
She further claims that the media and pharmaceutical industries are suppressing cancer cures, that 5G technology is a "weapon", and that drug and gambling addiction can be caused by bad spirits.
The Good Thinking Society's project director, Michael Marshall, has expressed concerns that Wilson's shows may discourage people from seeking medical help while "wasting their money," and that her anti-vaccine rhetoric may endanger children.
Several venues in the UK cancelled appearances by Wilson after Marshall contacted them about these concerns.
The NZ Skeptics made a similar effort to urge venues to cancel Wilson's events during her tour of New Zealand.
The chair of the organization, Craig Shearer, voiced concerns about the risk of participants forgoing medical care and suffering financial exploitation.
After being contacted by Marshall, the UK Advertising Standards Authority cautioned Wilson to, according to Wilson, comply with UK regulations and "remove any claims to work with spirit world doctors, any videos that mention any diseases.
I am only able to say that I can give people a feeling of well being.”
At her shows, Wilson advertises a dietary supplement, called alfa PXP ROYALE, made from micronized black rice.
The supplement is sold by a Enzacta, a multi-level marketing company for which Wilson is a paid promoter, at a dramatic markup relative to the cost of whole purple rice sold in supermarkets or micronised purple rice sold online.
A surgeon interviewed by Australia's "A Current Affair" television show criticized the marketing of the supplement, stating that customers are "wasting their money, and for this product a large amount of money; and secondly, they may be led to believe they don’t need to take their effective treatments for conditions they may actually have.” Despite this, Wilson claims that the "purple powder" can help elderly people "keep their vibrations up", and at one performance she invited an audience member to speak with her about the "best thing for scar tissue" off camera, so that "trading standards don't become all uppity."

But I'm sure that intellectual maturity doesn't have much to do with age... Maybe there have been some changes in my life that make me feel the difference.
Yes, the environment has changed, friends and acquaintances have changed, I have lost some of my friends and made new friends... Life does not stop and goes on...
But that's not all because I'm writing my own memories!
Every part of life is important and has a particular value to me, because I see that every individual is inherently distinct, because Almighty God created him or her different from other people, so every individual is exceptional and can only exist once, and this experience is unique...
It seems we got into philosophical talk and got away from topic.
Let's go back to the subject... Hmmm, what made me write my memoir?
Yes...

Excerpt from the book: When she was asked first time about the journey ahead, her mother, Fatima, responded indirectly to her by these statements.
She told her about Yasmeen's flower, which her name comes from it.
She said Yasmeen's flower is always convinced to the least.
This plant does not need much care.
A single drop of fertilizer per each spring is enough for it.
Suffice it to be slightly moist, then no irrigation is needed.
All types of jasmine flowers prefer to grow in a sunny place but also tolerate the presence of shade.
The Tunisian sun is suitable for blossoming and completing personality of this flower, but it has the ability to withstand the shade and cold climate of Europe.
Like the Mediterranean white jasmine, which is very delicate in appearance but strong in character.
Yasmeen's unique fragrance conveys a sense of sincerity that other roses lack.<br>
She did not ask about the importance of the emotions that this flower brings.
She knew that giving a woman a jasmine flower sometimes meant, "Why didn't you ever love me?"
Just as her father had given her, Yasmeen, to her mother.
It was her father's last gift to her mother because he had been evading custody of Yasmeen after divorce.
After that, her mother never accepted anyone's love because she had dedicated herself to love for Yasmeen.<br>She increasingly felt the absence of his mother more day after day.
Over time, she became more confident that she would be lost without him.
She knew that being a foreigner was not an easy experience.
However, he had agreed to take the trip.
Her mother had taught him how to be a real jasmine, but she may have overlooked the bitter truth: When it leaves its soil, Jasmine quickly fades away and wraps itself beautifully in the dry.

Part of the text of the book: Everything was cool and exciting until I decided to make a change in my desperate path and do something extraordinary to get me out of this absurdity hell.
After that, in one of the autumn night, when I stepped on the boat that had stopped on the shore, the moonlight has faded from my life, and my life became a improvisations series of exceptional cases.
From then on, I went through different adventures and endangered my life many times.
I became close to the borders of death by drowning and deprived myself of justice, I even almost fell into the realm of the dead.
Over and over, I found myself hoping to return to a monotonous life with no excitement.
I was scared to be forgotten in a corner and die alone.
I was afraid that I had ruined my normal life for nothing!
This book has been published in Arabic and in novel form.
The novel mainly scrutinizes the Tunisian revolution and the effects that these failed revolutions have on the people.
This is part of the text: If she could paint a simple picture of her life, of course if she had been so aware, she recognized that it was all just suffering.
Each suffering depicts a different path, expressing certain meanings that she was unaware of it... Every suffering had to search for the next suffering to find its way...
In the meantime she was looking for a way to get rid of it and always asked: Which event, like a tornado, shook the pillars of her monotonous life?...
Just when there was an incentive to keep going, everything seemed void to her... Like a fisherman who fished a fish then thrown it into the sea and wait for a bigger fish...

Tayside Junior Football League
The Tayside Junior Football League , originally called the "Midlands League", was a football league competition operated in Tayside under the Scottish Junior Football Association which operated as the top league in the territory until a merger in 2002; it existed for a further four years as a second-tier league before the name was discontinued in 2006.
Junior football had been played in the region since the 1890s, but it was not until a restructuring across Scotland in the late 1960s that all teams in the territory were brought together under one umbrella - previously they had been competing in the local leagues in Angus, Perthshire and Dundee, though the membership of these was not always rigidly dependant on geography, and another "Midland League" also existed from the 1920s to the 1940s involving clubs from all three territories.
Due to predicted difficulties in arranging the new format, an extra year was requested for its completion by the local committees, and the Midland (Tayside) leagues began in 1969, a year after the rest of Scotland (the North was the only one of the six new regions which required more than minor adjustment to its structure).
With titles having been shared between clubs from Perthshire and Dundee (the sole Angus champions in 1974 being Kirrie Thistle), the league's balance altered dramatically in 1990 when Tayport joined the setup; their base was actually in the far north of Fife but they were permitted to join the Tayside league as they were closer to many of its teams via the Tay Road Bridge.
The "Port" almost immediately began to dominate and did not finish outside the top two places from 1991 until 2002, when the Tayside leagues were merged with the Fife League and the East (Lothians) league to form a new Scottish Junior Football Association, East Region Superleague.
Despite the challenge of facing the strongest clubs from these other two areas, Tayport continued to be among the leading teams for the first six years; Dundee side Lochee United also finished as East Region champions twice in that period.
Tayside's setup was retained as a feeder division to the Superleague along with the other historic districts until 2006, when they were fully integrated into the East Region; Tayside's section (minus the Perthshire teams which were placed with the Fife sides) became the North Division below the Super League and a new Premier Division.
In 2018, a large group of East Junior clubs joined the East of Scotland Football League, aspiring to gain entry to the senior Scottish Professional Football League in future years; however, on Tayside the only ones to do so were the Perth teams Jeanfield Swifts and Kinnoull.
This led to a North-South reorganisation of the remaining members of the region, with the 2019–20 Superleague North entirely compsed of former Tayside clubs.

Typhoon Phanfone (2019)
Typhoon Phanfone, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ursula, was a relatively strong and deadly tropical cyclone which traversed through the Philippines on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day for the first time since Nock-ten in 2016.
The twenty-ninth and final named storm of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season, the origins of Phanfone can be traced to an upper-level low which had formed near the Caroline Islands and gradually organized into a tropical depression on December 19.
Moving generally west-northwestard, the system intensified into a tropical storm on December 22 and moved into the Philippine Area of Responsibility on the following day as it continued gaining strength.
Phanfone intensified to typhoon status shortly before making its first landfalls over the Eastern Visayas region on Christmas Eve.
Further intensification ensued until Christmas Day despite Phanfone making several landfalls over the central Philippine islands, peaking at 150 km/h (90 mph) 10-minute sustained winds with a central pressure dropping to 970 hPa.
Phanfone maintained its typhoon strength for several hours as it exited the Philippine landmass before unfavorable conditions caused it to rapidly deteriorate and dissipate over the South China Sea.
Phanfone crossed the central Philippines after the stronger Kammuri struck nearly the same region merely weeks prior, with a track fairly similar to 2013’s Haiyan.
The system caused destruction in the Visayas region, particularly over Samar, Leyte and Iloilo.
The total fatalities of the said typhoon is 50 deaths (with 55 people missing, and over 300 injured) and the damages is at or roughly .
Prior to its formation on December 19, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a low pressure system to the southeast of Micronesia.
Showing signs of convection and sufficient banding around a defined center, the JTWC subsequently upgraded its initial warning to a medium chance of development.
Shortly thereafter on December 20, JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, while the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued its first advisory on the system.
By December 22, the system gained tropical storm strength and JMA issued the named "Phanfone."
Moving generally west-northwestward, Phanfone moved into the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) at 5:00 am PST December 23 and the Philippine weather bureau PAGASA locally named the system as "Ursula".
Owing to favorable conditions, Phanfone intensified further into a severe tropical storm hours later.
By afternoon of December 24, Phanfone gained typhoon strength shortly before making its first three landfalls over Salcedo, Eastern Samar (4:45 pm PST), Tacloban City (7:30 pm PST), and Cabucgayan, Biliran (9:15 pm PST).
Further intensification ensued until December 25, with Phanfone peaking at 00:00 UTC with 150 km/h (90 mph) 10-minute sustained winds and a central pressure dropping to 970 hPa; the JTWC reported that Phanfone peaked at 175 km/h 1-minute sustained winds, equivalent to a Category 2 typhoon.
Phanfone continued its west-northwestward track and, by afternoon of the same day, PAGASA had reported four additional landfalls: Gigantes Islands (2:30 am PST), Ibajay, Aklan (8:40 am PST), Semirara Island (1:00 pm PST), and Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro (3:00 pm PST).
By December 26, Phanfone had already exited the Philippine landmass, moving northwest over the South China Sea.
After holding strength for several hours, the system began losing strength due to unfavorable sea surface temperatures, medium wind shear and dry air intrusion.
On December 27, Phanfone dropped to tropical storm status while rapidly deteriorating and slowly moving.
On December 28, PAGASA issued its final warning as the system exited the PAR; later, JMA issued their final advisories as Phanfone weakened below warning threshold.
The PAGASA issued a signal 3 warning to Northern Samar, Samar, Eastern Samar, Leyte, Biliran and the Camotes Islands, meaning that 65-92 knot (75-106 mph; 121–170 km/h) winds were expected.
The PAGASA also issued a signal 2 warning to the Visayas, meaning that 33-65 knot (38-75 mph; 61–120 km/h) winds were to be expected within 24 hours.
It was issued to the central portion of northern Cebu, northeastern Iloilo, northern Antique, Capiz, Aklan, Southern Leyte, and Negros Occidental, which meant that Phanfone was taking a similar path to the areas hit by the much stronger Typhoon Haiyan.
The Visayas was the worst hit, with Iloilo City having 13 casualties alone that had been either struck by fallen trees, electrocuted or drowned.
Roxas, Tacloban and Maasin all received 140 mm (5.5 inches) of rain.
The extent of damage in the Philippines was quite far, with the Boracay Airport being heavily damaged as many people were stranded in the airport as the typhoon struck.
A disaster response officer also reported that power outages and damage in the town of Batad in Iloilo Province made it appear as a “ghost town”.
Severe flooding caused devastating damage in the many provinces and islands of Visayas as rain spread across the region, with many houses and vehicles being partially to completely submerged.
Multiple houses were crumpled and trees were downed, as well as power lines being downed.
All of these obstacles blocked off roads and made roads dangerous to walk on; and the excessive amounts of rainfall made ground, especially higher ground, very unstable.
The province of Leyte was placed under a state of calamity following the damage of the typhoon, with livestock, crops and infrastructure being damaged in excess of $1 million USD.
Most of the casualties are estimated to have taken place at Iloilo, as the village was badly hit with severe and swift-moving flash floods.
Tacloban was hit as fires broke out and winds allowed them to spread but it the 220,000 inhabitants escaped the worst of the system.
147 cities were affected by power outages but by Friday, December 27, 31 of those 147 had their power restored.
Because of the upcoming Christmas celebrations, 16,000 passengers who had holiday plans in their respective provinces with their families, were stranded in port for their safety due to the threat of the typhoon.
Upon making landfall near Salcedo in Eastern Samar around 4:45 PM, it was reported that the typhoon was causing major flooding and mudslides in the region.
As the storm quickly and unexpectedly intensified, over 58,000 people were evacuated in advance of the typhoon.
Five fishermen were reported missing and a 70-year-old man died after his house was swept away and as a result, he drowned.
Around 2,351 people have been affected by the typhoon and 1,654 were taking refuge in evacuation centers.
The World Food Programme issued advisories and infographics plotting the projected path of Phanfone, as well as evacuation and relief centers.
As of December 27, 2019, there are at least 28 confirmed fatalities according to the Philippines Disaster Agency, including a 13-year-old boy who was electrocuted.
A signal 2 warning was also issued to Luzon, with the southern portion of Quezon, Marinduque, Oriental Mindoro, Occidental Mindoro including Lubang Island, Romblon, Albay, Sorsogon, Burias Island, Calamian and Cuyo Islands all forecast to be in the path of Phanfone.
A signal 1 warning was issued to Bulacan, Bataan, Metro Manila, Rizal, rest of Quezon, Laguna, Batangas, Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte, Catanduanes and northern Palawan.
The island's governor ordered local government units to conduct a forced evacuation plan, prompting civilians near flood-prone areas and areas with the potential to be affected by landslides, to relocate temporarily as a safety precaution.
Local representatives visited residents in Libon, Maninila and Tandarora to advise them to evacuate and temporarily celebrate Christmas in evacuation centers for their safety.
Many public schools were open in order to serve as shelters for residents while the provincial government distributed food packs to the evacuees.
In Naval, the local government unit deployed evacuation tents for evacuees on Monday, December 23 with some tents reserved for senior citizens, pregnant women and people with disabilities.
Personnel of the Romblon Provincial Mobile Force Company were deployed and conducted an inventory of Search and Rescue (SAR) equipment on December 23 in preparation for the typhoon.
San Jose experienced 217 mm (8.64 inches) of rain in just under 24 hours.
Upwards of 58,000 people were evacuated from Luzon and its surrounding islands as the system brought torrential rain and severe flash flooding ensued as a result of the rains.
One family was swept away whilst trying to reach higher ground.
Water and power services were completely cut off, and restoration was estimated to take weeks.
Due to extensive damage done by Typhoon Phanfone in the Philippines, PAGASA announced that the name "Ursula" will be removed from the list of typhoon names, and the agency named 'Ugong' to replace 'Ursula'.

Henry Cow: The World Is a Problem
Henry Cow: The World Is a Problem is a 2019 book by American academic Benjamin Piekut.
It is a biography and analysis of the English experimental rock group Henry Cow and their turbulent existence between 1968 and 1978.
The book is Piekut's second and was published in September 2019 in the United States by Duke University Press in hard- and soft-cover.
Piekut is a historian of experimental music and an associate professor of music at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.
He had previously written "Experimentalism Otherwise: The New York Avant-Garde and Its Limits" (2011), had edited "Tomorrow Is the Question: New Directions in Experimental Music Studies" (2014), and co-edited with George E. Lewis "Oxford Handbook of Critical Improvisation Studies" (2016).
Piekut has also publshed several papers on Henry Cow, including "Music for Socialism, London 1977" (2019), and "Another Version of Ourselves: The Enigmas of Improvised Subjectivity" (2018).
Piekut sourced the content of "The World Is a Problem" from interviews (published and unpublished), notebooks and diaries, magazine and newspaper articles, journal papers, and books.
He conducted his own interviews between 2011 and 2016 with all living members of Henry Cow and those associated with the band, and was granted access to personal archives of several players, including Fred Frith, Tim Hodgkinson, Chris Cutler, Lindsay Cooper and Peter Blegvad.
Piekut wrote in the book's Preface that where written records and memories disagreed, "only by reading many of them together and against one another has it been possible to determine what actually happened with any accuracy."
The sock painting on the book's cover is by artist Ray Smith and was originally used on the cover of Henry Cow's second album, "Unrest" (1974).
Piekut took the book's subtitle, "The World Is a Problem" from a statement Hodgkinson made in one of his notebooks, paraphrasing Paulo Freire in "Pedagogy of the Oppressed", that Henry Cow wants to "transform the world; the world is a problem, not a given".
"The World Is a Problem" chronicles the history of Henry Cow and their exploration of music and activism, from their inception in 1968 to their break-up in 1978.
It also analyses of the nature of the band and the way they functioned.
They were a collective with a strict work-ethic that demanded total commitment from its members.
They held regular meetings where all aspects of the group, its music and activities were debated.
This tended to suppress individualism and made the band more important than its members, which strained relationships within the group, and with partners on the outside.
The book explains how Henry Cow were at odds with the status quo, the music industry and the world at large.
They were politically outspoken and embraced Marxism and Maoism.
They were not content to settle and continually experimented with new ideas.
The brief merger with Slapp Happy in 1975, the formation of the Orckestra with the Mike Westbrook Brass Band and folk singer Frankie Armstrong in 1977, and the establishment of the Rock in Opposition movement in 1978, were some of several ventures they initiated.
Henry Cow's approach to composition is discussed, and the musical structure and lyrics (where present) of many of their more prominent works, including Frith's "Ruins" and Hodgkinson's "Living in the Heart of the Beast", are analysed in detail.
The band improvised much of their music, particularly during live performances, and this style of playing included free improvisation, studio improvisation to tape (for example on their 1974 album, "Unrest"), and open improvisation.
Reviewing "Henry Cow: The World Is a Problem" in the British progressive rock magazine, "Prog", Sid Smith called it an "impressively detailed account [that] chronicle[s] [Henry Cow's] triumphs and camaraderie".
He added that through their "often-turbulent existence", the band's struggle "against the prevailing tides of commerciality and popular culture ... has a heroic quality about it".
Smith wrote that if the success of a music biography is measured by the desire to revisit the group's albums, then this book is "enormously successful".
He said Piekut's "forensic examination" of Henry Cow's recordings adds another dimension to their music.
Smith concluded that the book "is a fitting tribute to Henry Cow's importance and legacy in a notable but marginalised movement of 20th-century music."
Phil Howitt wrote in the Canterbury scene magazine, "FaceLift" that while Henry Cow may not have been part of the Canterbury scene, Piekut's book can be read as "almost a parallel narrative to that of the Canterbury scene", given the number of musicians from that "genre" who either played in, or were associated with, the band.
Howitt described "The World Is a Problem" as a "definitive biography" that is "meticulously researched" leaving few stones unturned.
He said that just as Henry Cow were "an intensely serious band", this is an "intensely serious book" that requires "considerable powers of concentration and assiduousness".
Howitt found the analyses of their different types of improvisation and their political alignments "heavy going".
He also felt that the in-depth descriptions of some of the band's compositions were "somewhat unnecessary" as they would only benefit a limited audience.
What was also missing, Howett felt, was a timeline of events covering Henry Cow's history.
But overall Howett called "The World Is a Problem" "a remarkable project" that is "compelling [and] unique".
Chris Cutler, Henry Cow's drummer, described the book as a "cornucopia of invaluable information".
He said it is a well-researched and detailed account of the band, but suggested that in places, it is "best [to] read between the lines".
Because some of the band members kept more detailed records than others, their viewpoints tend to feature more prominently in the book, leaving some parts "uneven".
Cutler added that where Piekut had to interpret different people's accounts of events, it is likely that not everyone in the band will concur with his analysis.
Cutler said that "subjectivities are profoundly complex", and attempts to "unearth things that were already hidden when they were current" will be "guided by [personal] biases and interests".

The event planning was counteracted by efforts to stop the rally.
Some of the local residents claimed that application for road closures was not properly dealt with.

After consultation with local politicians and the Galway County Council it was ruled that the organisers have complied with all of the procedures relating to a temporary road closure, and that the event is cleared to go ahead.
Couple months after the event a High Court case against the rally organizers was brought up.

Roger Steinmann
Roger Steinmann ([]; born November 6, 1961 in Zurich, Switzerland) is a filmmaker and entrepreneur.
Most notable is his biopic "Illusion Infinity" (aka "Paradise", 2004), starring Dee Wallace, Mickey Rooney, Timothy Bottoms, Barbara Carrera, Martin Kove, and Theresa Saldana.
At the age of eight, Steinmann borrowed his uncle’s Super-8 camera.
He shot his very first motion picture ‘Zurich’ (1969), a five minute-documentary.
When the Swiss national TV in 1974 launched a youth-film-competition based on the key-word ‘door’, Steinmann directed his first feature ‘Die Türe’ (‘The Door’, 1975).
Steinmann casted both lead roles in ‘Die Türe’ with Peter Bürgisser and André Bellmont.
A string of short features and documentaries followed.
Notably are:
‘Die Flutkatastrophe’ (‘Flood Disaster’, 1977) was labeled ‘Switzerland’s first disaster movie.
It depicts a major water dam-break what subsequently floods the metropole of Zurich.
It won numerous awards.
And, it was aired on Swiss national TV on November 4, 1978 together with a live-interview with Steinmann.
‘’ ('The Machine-Animals', 1977) is a 22-minute documentary analyzing large-scale husbandry against classic farming.
Still in his teens, Steinmann aimed to execute larger scale feature-projects based on his original screenplays.
In 1978/79, he developed the conception ‘Krebs!’ (‘Cancer!’) about the life-threatening virus in a woman’s organism, visualized by a simultaneous life-threat of the organism of an entire city by a Godzilla-like monster-crab.
In German language the title ‘Krebs!’ bears the double meaning of Cancer and Crab.
The project had huge dimensions in respect of budget but as well of, at the time, demanding special effects.
Therefore, the project stalled.
Steinmann turned to theater as well; notable are:
1982: ‘Beschti Referenze’ (aka ‘Buchhalter Noetzli’, ‘Bookkeeper Noetzli’) with Steinmann producing and directing.
1986: ‘Achtung-Fertig-Los!’ (‘Ready-Steady-Go!’) as producer and writer, with directing.
Imthurn became Steinmann’s long time partner.
1988: ‘Schelmereie’ (‘Sweet Cheating’, 1988) as a director at the theater in Oberentfelden, Switzerland.
From 1991, Steinmann lived alternatively in Los Angeles.
There, he wrote several screenplays on spec, alone but mostly in association, e.g.
'Bum and the Kid' with Scott Steindorff, outlines, e.g.
‘Love of my Life’ with Don Mankiewicz, rewrites, e.g.
‘Project: Metalbeast’.
Among Steinmann´s several projects, Illusion Infinity (aka Paradise, 2004) caught the eye of casting director Gerald I. Wolff.
He was able to engage six well known Hollywood actors: Dee Wallace, Mickey Rooney, Timothy Bottoms, Barbara Carrera, Martin Kove, and Theresa Saldana.
‘Illusion Infinity’ was labeled as biopic; however, it was an original screenplay by Steinmann about the supposed real Las Vegas singer Patricia Paradise (played by Dee Wallace) and her life-long search for a genuine soul-mate, and a home she calls ‘Shangri-La’.
In 2014, Thai film star Mike Angelo became interested to star in ‘The Partykillers’, a screwball-comedy about a humble inventor of a magical teddy-bear crashing the engagement party of a toy manufacturer.
This screenplay Steinmann wrote back in 1995/98 in collaboration with Rodney Heeringa.
But another concept of a screwball comedy fit Angelo’s talent even better: A male singer gaining success only when performing as a woman, attracting both a father and his daughter.
After Angelo agreed to star in this dual role, Steinmann originated the 2015-screenplay ‘Ladies First’.
Swiss actors Beat Schlatter and Pascal Ulli confirmed their interest to participate, the latter also as co-produce.
Our world caught up with constant (ab-)use of cell-phones: What would happen if all cells and computers became unusable?
This topic led to the 2016/2018-screenplay 'PhonY' with the unique interactivity between segments in Los Angeles, Switzerland, Australia, Thailand and Canada.
In spring 2018, the filming commenced in Switzerland with Pascal Ulli and Gilles Tschudi; it was followed by the Thai segment.
The remaining segments with Burt Reynolds and Barbara Carrera were scheduled in Los Angeles for October 2018.
Though, a mere month before, Burt Reynolds untimely passed away, and the production stalled temporarily.
It is aimed for a 2020 delivery.
In 2018, Steinmann started to film the farce-comedy "PhonY" in Switzerland and Thailand.
The Los Angeles-segment had to be canceled due to lead actor Burt Reynolds' untimely death.
In December 2019, Golden Globe winner Elke Sommer agreed to participate.
1983: Steinmann invented an automatic bottle stopper; patented in 1985.
1983: Steinmann prevailed over 73 candidates in the German TV-quiz show ‘Alles oder Nichts’ with a record-breaking TV-live-audience of 15 Mio.
1984: Steinmann founded the Rotsch AG, a joint-stock company, to market his invention.
At that time, he was 22 years old and became the youngest president ever of such an entity in Switzerland.
He sold that entity in 1996.
1995: Steinmann founded the SUNSET International AG, a joint-stock company, to produce films.

French occupation of Thessaly
The French occupation of Thessaly took place in June 1917, during the First World War, as part of the Allied intervention in the Greek National Schism.
The chief military clash of the occupation became known as the Battle of the Flag ().

The chief military confrontation of the operation occurred when the French attempted to disarm the 1/38 Evzone Regiment in Larissa, under the command of Lt.
Colonel Athanasios Frangos.
The regiment refused to obey the command to surrender its weapons, and retreated west towards the mountains.
The French launched Moroccan sipahis in pursuit of the unit, encircling it and forcing it to surrender after clashes (named "Battle of the Flag", as the Greeks carried the regimental standard with them) that claimed the lives of 59 Greek officers and soldiers, as well as seven killed and 15 wounded on the French side.
At the same time the Allies issued an ultimatum to Constantine threatening to bombard Athens.

In order to occupy this gap left in the city, the three friends came together and developed the project, joining a professional club Arraial do Cabo (CEAC) with Araruama Futebol Clube.
The elaboration of a team made up of local players is a recipe for success.
For years, championship after championship, the city attracted fans who continued to support and make a healthy movement, a cause of joy and leisure for city dwellers.
The AFC comes to supply this absence and add its existence in the history of the city's sport.

Ranjit Sitaram Pandit
Ranjit Sitaram Pandit (1893 – 14 January 1944) was an Indian barrister, Congressman, linguist and scholar from Rajkot in the Kathiawar district of India.
He is known for his role in the Indian non-cooperation movement, and for translating the Sanskrit texts "Mudrarakshasa", "Ṛtusaṃhāra" and Kalhana's "Rajatarangini" into English.
He was the husband of Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, the son-in-law of Motilal Nehru, brother-in-law of Jawaharlal Nehru and father of Nayantara Sahgal.
Until 1926, he was a barrister in Calcutta, a position he resigned to join the Indian non-cooperation movement.
In 1930, he was the Secretary of the Peshawar Enquiry Committee, which investigated the troubles in the North West Frontier Province.
Later, he was appointed a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (UP).
Pandit died in 1944, shortly after being released from his fourth imprisonment by the British.
Ranjit Sitaram Pandit was born in 1893, to the wealthy British-educated lawyer Sitaram Narayan Pandit, in Rajkot in the Kathiawar district of India.
His ancestors came from Bambuli village in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra and his family consisted of a number of lawyers and Sanskrit scholars.
Amongst his siblings was a brother, Pratap, and two sisters, Ramabai and Tarabai.
He was a linguist and spoke eleven languages, including Hindi, Persian, Bengali, English, French and German, and like his father, he studied law in England.
Prior to entering the Middle Temple, he attended Christ Church College, University of Oxford.
He had also attended the Sorbonne University and the University of Heidelberg.
He had an interest in horticulture, could play the violin and was proficient at tennis, polo, cricket, swimming and hunting.
In 1920, Mahadev Desai, a friend of Pandit's from college, recommended that Sarup Nehru, Motilal Nehru's daughter, read Pandit's article published in "Modern Review" titled "At the Feet of the Guru".
Desai was then secretary to Mahatma Gandhi, who was a family friend to the Pandits in Kathiawar.
Pandit and Sarup Nehru were subsequently introduced to each other and he proposed to her the following day, writing in one note that "I have come many miles and crossed many bridges to come to you—but in the future you and I must cross our bridges hand in hand".
On 10 May 1921, the anniversary of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, they married, upon which, she adopted the name Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit.
With the Nehrus now involved in the Indian non-cooperation movement and in boycotting British goods, the wedding was the last event in the Nehru household "approaching opulence at Anand Bhavan".
Their first daughter, Vatsala, died at the age of nine months.
Subsequently, they had three daughters; Chandralekha Mehta, Nayantara Sahgal and Rita Dar, born in 1924, 1927 and 1929 respectively.
On 1 March 1926, Pandit, together with his wife Vijaya Lakshmi, his brother-in-law Jawaharlal Nehru, sister-in-law Kamala Nehru and niece Indira, sailed to Europe on the Lloyd liner "Triestino".
He returned with Vijaya Lakshmi the following November.
Until this European trip, Pandit was a successful lawyer who practiced in what was then called Calcutta with Sir B. L. Mitter.
Against the wishes of his family in Rajkot, he became a Satyagrahi and joined Mahatma Gandhi and Motilal Nehru in the Indian non-cooperation movement and settled in Allahabad, where he took up cases in the courts.
Later, they moved to Khali, in the hills near Almora.
When the Indian National Congress's 1928 proposal for Dominion status was rejected by the British, the party took a pledge of non-cooperation and demanded "complete independence".
Vijaya Lakshmi later recorded in her autobiography, that on 29 December 1929, upon the declaration of independence by the Congress's then president Jawaharlal Nehru, Pandit joined him in the celebrations.
In 1930, Motilal Nehru appointed Pandit the Secretary of the Peshawar Enquiry Committee, to investigate troubles in the North West Frontier Province.
Its report was published by Allahabad's Law Journal Press.
In 1937, he was listed in "The Indian Annual Register" as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) of United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (UP), to which he was elected along with Vijaya Lakshmi.
He served several prison terms, including two prison sentences with Jawaharlal Nehru, one in Naini Central Jail in 1931 and another at Dehradun.
His daughter, Nayantara, later described how she ate chocolate cake the day her father first went to prison.
She later became a writer, and associating chocolate cake with prison, wrote a book titled "Prison and Chocolate Cake".
While in prison, Pandit translated into English Kalhana's "Rajatarangini", the 12th century history of the kings of Kashmir, written in Sanskrit, and described the poem as one of "great scope, a more or less complete picture of society, in which the bloody periods of the past are delightfully relieved by delicate tales of love, by episodes of marvel and mystery and by interesting digressions which the author permits himself".
The foreword to the translation was written by Jawaharlal Nehru.
He translated from Sanskrit to English, the play "Mudrarakshasa" and in 1942 completed the translation of "Ṛtusaṃhāra".
In 1943, he was reported to have had pneumonia, pleurisy and a heart attack in Bareilly Central Jail.
Vijaya Lakshmi visited him, and later described how "it was a tremendous shock to see Ranjit brought in to the superintendant's office on a stretcher.
His head had been shaved and he was emaciated and almost unrecognisable”.
He had been arrested that year by British authorities and was serving his fourth term in prison.
He died shortly after being released.
On 18 January 1944, Nehru wrote to his daughter Indu, that he was informed that Pandit (Pupha to Indu) died in Lucknow on 14 January 1944, before the reformation of personal law which was completed after independence, leaving his widow to raise their three daughters without an inheritance.
Pandit's brother, Pratap, had frozen their assets.
Author Katherine Frank wrote in her biography of Indira Gandhi, that Pandit's death "was an unnecessary death directly attributable to the poor conditions and treatment he had received in jail.
Winston Churchill was later reported by Pandit's widow, on a visit to England after independence of India, to have said to her that “we killed your husband didn't we”.
Pandit's daughter, Nayantara, wrote in her biography of Nehru that her mother replied "no, every man lives only to his appointed hour" and Churchill replied "nobly spoken".

After studying at Copenhagen University and gaining a reputation for brilliance, he passed the Danish civil service exam and was awarded a travel bursary to pursue further studies abroad in geology and mineralogy.
For two years he and his friend Henrik Steffens studied together in Berlin and later in Freiberg, under the mineralogist Abraham Gottlob Werner.
Møller then travelled to Paris, to study under René Just Haüy and Georges Cuvier, before rejoining Steffens at the University of Jena to sit at the feet of Friedrich Schelling.
After a conversion experience during an illness, he was received into the Catholic Church in Hamburg, on 27 January 1804, the day of his marriage to Elisabeth Charlotte Alberti.
His wife's sister was married to Ludwig Tieck.

Amritsar 1919
Amritsar 1919: An Empire of Fear and the Making of a Massacre (2019), is a book by Kim A. Wagner and published by Yale University Press, that aims to dispel myths surrounding the Jallianwala Bagh massacre that took place in Amritsar, India, on 13 April 1919.
In the absence of any photographs of the event and with significant differences between British and Indian accounts of how many were killed and how and why it happened, Wagner examines primary sources to trace the events leading up to the massacre and then discusses its aftermath.
According to Wagner, the background to the massacre starts with the Indian rebellion of 1857 and the subsequent British fear of a recurrence.
By 1919, Indians aspired to greater self-governance, a wish frustrated by the proposals of the Rowlatt Act.
The result was Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha movement, which persuaded Indians to pursue nonviolent resistance to the British.
Fearing another 1857, events in Amritsar unfolded into Indian political agitation, the arrest of two key Indian political leaders, and British panic.
Then came General Dyer's action towards a large peaceful crowd and the killings at Jallianwalla Bagh.
British authorities responded with martial law and the arrest and torture of a number of Indians in Amritsar.
Contrary to a number of widely held beliefs, Wagners research reveals an alternative number of how many were killed in the massacre, how many were found in the well and an account of why General Dyer acted as he did.
The book was released in 2019, the 100th anniversary of the massacre, and triggered responses in a number of publications including "The Hindustan Times", "The Telegraph" and the "London Review of Books".
Amongst the reviewers have been Sathnam Sanghera, Andrew Lycett, Tunku Varadarajan, Ferdinand Mount and Trevor Grundy.
"Amritsar 1919: An Empire of Fear and the Making of a Massacre" was published in 2019 by Yale University Press.
It is available in hard back, paper back and an audio version narrated by Neil Shah.
The author is Kim A. Wagner, who lectures on colonial India and the British Empire at Queen Mary, University of London.
He previously authored "" and "Thuggee".
The book has 360 pages, 26 black and white illustrations, four maps and 12 chapters preceded by an introduction and a section on acknowledgements.
Following the twelfth chapter is a conclusion and epilogue.
Wagner explains that "the Amritsar Massacre isn’t understood very well", particularly in the absence of any photographs of the 13 April 1919 and with a significant variation in British and Indian accounts of how many were killed and how and why it happened.
In his book, he examines primary sources to trace the events leading up to the massacre and discusses its aftermath.
The book begins with a scene from Richard Attenborough’s 1982 film "Gandhi", what Wagner cites as the most popular depiction of the Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre and “how many people today think of what was arguably the bloodiest massacre in the history of the British Empire”.
According to Wagner, understanding the massacre requires beginning with the Indian rebellion of 1857.
In 1919, the continuing fear of a revolution led to the proposal of the suppressive Rowlatt Act which would give the British powers to quash any political agitation, and contradicted the simultaneous British promises with the Indian National Congress to give greater involvement to Indians in government.
Mahatma Gandhi responded by proposing that all Indians oppose the Act and make a Satyagraha pledge, a promise to resist without using violence.
The subsequent call for general strikes in late March 1919 then led to the arrest of two local Indian leaders.
On 10 April 1919, upon hearing of the arrests, a crowd of Indians issued a petition for the release of their leaders.
When British officials panicked and fired in reaction to seeing the approaching crowd, riots erupted.
On that day, Wagner explained, “European civilians had been killed by Indian rioters, and white women had been attacked by brown men”, for the first time since 1857.
The British subsequently banned all future gatherings.
However, the ban was not widely acknowledged and “many either unaware of the proclamation or not believing that the British would actually resort to violence, proceeded to announce a meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh that would take place on April 13, 1919”.
The crowd at Jallianwalla Bagh was composed of mainly men and many from out of town, making up to 20,000 people, who had mostly come to celebrate a religious festival.
Speeches focussed on the Rowlatt Act, the call to release the two arrested local Indian leaders, and effects on Indians of the First World War.
In Wagner's words "on the 13th of April, 1919, there was nobody in Jallianwala Bagh who thought about independence.
They were not heroic freedom fighters.
They still had an abiding belief in the ultimate justice of the Raj, and they still thought of the British government as being the arbiter of justice".
When General Dyer arrived "he was overwhelmed by the sheer size of the gathering that he had walked in on" and assumed it was a rebellion.
Wagner explains that the British response was of "racialized fear and violent suppression".
Afterwards, there was no British help with removing the dead or medical assistance for the injured.
Instead, the British authorities imposed curfews, a crawling order and martial law and those suspected of being involved in the 10 April riots were arrested and tortured.
British censorship ensured suppression of the details of the Amritsar troubles and the massacre, until October 1919.
In July 1920, the matter was discussed in the House of Commons.
Some noted the “un-English” nature of what happened and took his actions as a "blemish on an otherwise untarnished British rule".
Others saw Dyer's actions as necessary.
Using primary sources to gather evidence, Wagner has clarified that the book aims to dispel a number of myths surrounding the events of the massacre in Amritsar on 13 April 1919.
Contrary to a number of widely held beliefs, Wagner's research reveals 500 to 600 is a more likely “plausible estimate” of the number killed at the Bagh on 13 April 1919, and that “eyewitness accounts recall only one or two bodies as having been recovered from the well inside the park”.
That number, however, he says, does not "actually change the enormity of what happened".
In 2019, coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the massacre at Jallianwalla Bagh, the book triggered responses in a number of publications including "The Spectator" by William Dalrymple, who noted that Wagner had used extensive primary sources in his research and "almost every sentence is footnoted — gets as close as we are ever likely to get to the truth of what happened in Jallianwalla Bagh.
In the process, he demolishes a large number of myths that have grown up around the event, both imperial and nationalist".
Andrew Lycett, writing in "The Telegraph", described the book as having skilfully mapped out the events.
Reporting in "The Times", Tunku Varadarajan agreed with Wagner that the book is a "a microhistory of a global event", aimed at neither those with "Raj nostalgia or Indian Nationalism".
These responses were also supported by John Newsinger.
However, Newsinger, with regards to the fear of another 1857, pointed out "one disagreement with Wagner's discussion of this is that on occasions it [the book] seems to suggest that the massacre was the result of a misunderstanding, that if the British had not been so obsessed with the events of the 1850s then the massacre might never have taken place".
Trevor Grundy recommended the book be taught at schools and colleges.
Ferdinand Mount in the "London Review of Books", noted that General Dyer's evidence is quoted at length in the book.
Both Grundy and Mount compared "Amritsar 1919" with Nick Lloyd's "The Amritsar Massacre: The Untold Story of One Fateful Day" (2011) and with Nigel Collett's "The Butcher of Amritsar" (2005).
Mount argued that Wagner had underplayed the personality of General Dyer, portraying him as "nothing exceptional ... and nothing extraordinary", instead emphasising that it was "brutality" in general that was the "driving principle of the Raj" rather than the personality of individuals.
Wagner responded to Mount's view that "Dyer and the massacre were unique" and that the massacre "was all down to the personality of one officer", by citing the other brutal incidents mentioned by Mount "in which British officers in India from 1857 onward resorted to exemplary and indiscriminate massacres", such as those ordered by Hector Munro, Frederick Cooper and General James Neill.
"Amritsar 1919" has also been reviewed along with other books revolved around the massacre, including Anita Anand's "The Patient Assassin".
Reviews also appeared in "The Hindustan Times", and other commentators have included Sathnam Sanghera.

Paul V. Malloy
Paul V. Malloy is the presiding circuit court judge for Ozaukee County, Wisconsin.
He graduated with a Batchelor's degree in Business Administration from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 1981, and received his law degree from John Marshall Law School (Chicago) in 1985.
He was appointed to the bench in 2002, then elected to a full six-year term in 2003.
He was re-elected in 2009 and 2015.
His term expires in 2021.
In October 2014, Circuit Court Judge Joseph Voiland described a confrontation in which he and Molloy were standing “nearly nose to nose” and Malloy was yelling “as loud as I have heard anyone yell before.
Malloy admitted yelling but said the "nose to nose" dispute was exaggerated because there was a desk and chair between them.
In August 2015, Voiland jailed a woman after a hearing in which Voiland said he didn’t believe her, though Malloy released the woman after her attorney argued that Voiland didn’t establish any legal basis for holding her or provide for her an alternative method to seek release.
Randy Koschnick, the district judge at the time but now the director of state courts, had to intervene at times in disputes between Malloy and Voiland, including in June 2016 after Malloy ordered Court Commissioner Barry Boline not to follow orders issued by Voiland.
Voiland, speaking to a state investigator two years later, said he didn’t feel safe in his office after that and considered having security cameras installed.
In 2018, Voilland contended that the courts and county had historically failed to provide funding for the obligation to conduct home studies in child custody cases.
Unable to resolve the situation within the county, Voiland escalated his complaints to the state level.
In 2019, Malloy removed 234,000 voters from the statewide rolls, ruling that state law compelled him to do so.
The League of Women Voters, to whom Malloy refused to grant standing to intervene in the case, The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which was also denied standing by Malloy, has also filed suit in federal court to halt the contested purging.
Wisconsin's Attorney General Josh Kaul also file a notice of appeal to halt the purging, acting on behalf of the state's Elections Commission and requesting to stay of Malloy's order.
The issue was brought before the court by the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL).
The Institute is a right-wing organization mostly supported by the Bradley Foundation, which funds such political causes.
The lawsuit demanded that the Wisconsin Election Commission respond to a "Movers Report," generated from voter data analysis produced by the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a national, non-partisan partnership funded in 2012 by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
ERIC shares voter registration information to improve the accuracy of voter rolls.
The report tagged 234,039 voters who may have moved to an address that had not yet been updated on their voter registration forms.
Despite thin evidence for removal of that extraordinary number of qualified voters, Wisconsin may be forced to comply with Malloy's order.
On January 2, 2010, WILL said it asked the circuit court to hold the Elections Commission in contempt, fining it up to $12,000 daily, until it advances Malloy’s December 17, 2019 order to purge from the voting rolls hundreds of thousands of registered voters who possibly have moved to a different address.
The case being litigated in a state appeals court, but it was thought that the conservative-dominated Wisconsin Supreme Court would be likely to hear it.
Ozaukee County is heavily Republican, having voted for a Democratic presidential candidate only once after 1936 when it voted for Lyndon Johnson in 1964.
The purge was felt to be targeting voters living in the cities of Madison, and Milwaukee, and college towns, which all exhibit Democratic voting strength.
Two of the three plaintiffs in the case heard by Malloy were significant contributors to state Republican party candidates' campaigns, including former state representative and senator, David W. Opitz.
Disenfranchisement expert Greg Palast ties the Wisconsin effort at voter purging as part of a national Republican strategy.
Barrage de Portage-des-Roches
The Portage-des-Roches dam ("Portage-des-Roches being the translation of the Montagnais" "Ashini Kushnapagan") or " Taschereau Dam" (in honor of "Louis-Alexandre Taschereau") is a dam located in the Laterrière sector of borough Chicoutimi, at Saguenay (city), Quebec, Canada.
The largest water retaining structure in Kenogami Lake, this dam constitutes the source of the Chicoutimi River, whose flow is totally dependent on it.
Portage-des-Roches is located at confluence between Chicoutimi River and the eastern end of Kénogami Reservoir.
This natural corridor carved out by glaciation is a depression located between the elevation of Lac Jean-Deschênes that of the southern valley of the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean or Laurentides Wildlife Reserve.
As part of the main portage suite which links the Saguenay to Lac Saint-Jean, by Kenogami Lake and Chicoutimi River, Portage-des-Roches was borrowed by Father Jean Dequen in 1652.
In 1732, it was the surveyor Joseph-Laurent Normandin, who translated the Montagnais term "Ashini Kushnapagan" into "Portage-des-Roches".
In 2010, the Government of Quebec issued a call for tenders to improve the evacuation capacity of the spillway, raise the crest of the dam and replace wooden valves with steel valves with an independent system that can be controlled remotely.
The various works take account of the technical recommendations contained in the report of the Nicolet Commission.
The total cost of the rehabilitation project is estimated at $ 50 million.
The work must be completed in 2013.

The film was scanned in 4K format resolution in L'Immagine Ritrovata in Bologna, Italy using the 35mm prints from the ABS-CBN Film Archives.
The image comparison of the movie was carried out using the five (5) Positive Prints, the only existing film materials, which already showed mild to severe type of decay.
All five (5) Positive Prints have critical problems on color decay and focus problems that heavily affected the image.
The film elements have emulsion and base damages that have caused severe line scratches in the picture.
Reconstruction for the best copies that were used for each reel was tediously performed to achieve the best quality for digital restoration.
The most drastically affected reels are R3, being the only copy available and R5 due to the advanced chemical decay and focus problems.
Digital output shows the maximum level of restoration it can achieve.
The missing frames that could not be addressed in digital restoration, have also affected the motion of some shots.
Other picture defects such as dust/dirt, patches, continuous patches, single frame scratches, flicker, stabilization, splice mark, bump, squeeze, gate hair, continuous dust, continuous line scratch, stains, mold, mis-light, vertical band, and color breathing were successfully fixed and removed by the restoration artists of Kantana Post-Production (Thailand) Co., Ltd.

Payette City Hall and Courthouse
The Payette City Hall and Courthouse, at 3rd Ave. and 8th St. in Payette, Idaho, was built in 1912.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
It is a two-story brick building upon a raised foundation, built in Classical Revival style.
It is three bays wide, with bays separated by terra cotta pilasters, and four bays deep.
Its entry bay rises to a pedimented cornice.
The builder was J. Ronald Walker.
It was deemed "architecturally significant as a good local example of the Neo-Classical Revival style in Payette.
Although of modest scale and ornament, it nevertheless is one of the town's more outstanding structures and the major one in the downtown area to display Classical details and proportions.
Situated at the end of Third Avenue, Payette's main street, it dominates the streetscape in the north end, and for many years served as a symbol of civic authority.
Further contributing to the building's significance is its having functioned for a number of years as a seat of local government.
Not only did it house the city government, but after the formation of Payette County in 1917 it also contained the county government."
The city offices moved out in the 1950s and the county offices moved out in the 1970s.

RTE Studio bombing
The RTE Studio bombing was a bomb attack carried out by the Ulster Loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) in Dublin, Ireland.
It was the first Loyalist bombing in the Republic of Ireland during The Troubles.
In March and April 1969 the UVF and Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV) carried out a number of sabotage bombings and blamed them on the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
The attack took place on 5 August 1969 at 1:30 am.
The blast could be heard over a wide area of Dublin city, nobody was injured.
The bomb is believed to have been planted at the rear wall of the studio building and not much structural damage was done to the building, accept for the shattering of glass panels.
Later that morning all Irish daily newspapers had front-page coverage of the blast.
This was the start of a Loyalist campaign of bombings in the Republic of Ireland that would continue until the mid 1970s, with the deadliest being the Dublin and Monaghan bombings which killed 34.
On 19 October 1969, UVF & UPV member Thomas "Tommy" McDowell was electrocuted while planting a bomb at an electricity sub-station in Ballyshannon, County Donegal.
He died of his injuries three days later.
On 24 October, the UVF claimed responsibility for both the Ballyshannon and the RTÉ bombing.
The statement read "the attempted attack was a protest against the Irish Army units still massed on the border in Co Donegal".
The statement added: "so long as the threats from Éire continue, so long will the volunteers of Ulster's people's army strike at targets in Southern Ireland".
Until then the Irish security forces believed the RTE bombing was the work of Irish republicans who had a grudge against RTE.
The UVF carried out two more bomb attacks in the Republic that year: on the Wolfe Tone memorial in Bodenstown, County Kildare on 31 October, and on 26 December on the Daniel O'Connell monument in Dublin.
Six months after the RTE bombing the UVF struck again at RTE.
On 18 February 1970 it bombed a 240-foot radio mast on Mongary Hill, near Raphoe, County Donegal, putting the transmitter out of action.
The mast had allowed RTE radio signals to be broadcast into Northern Ireland.
The UVF claimed responsibility the next day.
UVF sabotage bombings continued sporadically in the Republic throughout 1970 and 1971.
Beautiful People (Big Country song)
"Beautiful People" is a song by Scottish rock band Big Country, released in 1991 as the second and final single from their fifth studio album "No Place Like Home".
It was written by Stuart Adamson and produced by Pat Moran.
"Beautiful People" reached No.
72 on the UK Singles Chart, and No.
36 on the BBC's Heavy Metal/Rock chart.
The song's music video was directed by Roger Pomphrey and shot at Peckham, London.
Speaking to the Big Country fanzine "Inwards" in 1991, Adamson said of the song: "This is about how you can find cool things in the most fucked-up places."
Upon release, Peter Kinghorn of "Newcastle Evening Chronicle" described "Beautiful People" as a "gently rolling singalong tune" with "plinking banjo and piano".
Craig McLean of "Vox" felt the song's piano "honks and tonks agreeably".
Steve Stewart of "The Press and Journal" considered "No Place Like Home" to present "a different style of music" from Big Country.
He commented: "There is a slower, more relaxed feel to their sound, as displayed in "Beautiful People"."
In a review of one of the band's 1991 concerts, David Sinclair of "The Times" noted the song's "honky-tonk piano, mandolin and mellow sentiments".
John Peel, reviewing the single for "New Musical Express", commented: "It sounds like Mungo Jerry.
My dad would have described it as half-baked piffle and he'd have been right.
Sorry, Stuart."
In a retrospective review of the single, JT Griffith of AllMusic felt "Return to the Two Headed King" and "Fly Like An Eagle" were "unimpressive", with "Beautiful People" being "by far [the] strongest song".

Hocquart Lake
The lac Hocquart is a freswater body crossed by the Pika River on the watershed of the Pikauba River and the Saguenay River.
Lac Hocquart is located in the unorganized territory of Lac-Achouakan, in the Lac-Saint-Jean-Est Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
This lake is located in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve.
This small valley is served indirectly by the route 169 and a few secondary routes for forestry, recreational tourism activities.
Forestry is the main economic activity in the sector; recreotourism activities, in second.
The surface of Lake Hocquart is usually frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March, but safe circulation on the ice is generally made from mid-December to mid-March.
The main watersheds near Lake Hocquart are:
Hocquart Lake is in the shape of a pallet hat, a width of and an altitude of .
This lake is mainly fed by the Pika River (coming from the west), by the Gobeil stream (coming from the east) and by the outlet (coming from the south) of Lac Larivière.
The mouth of this lake is located at:
From the mouth of Lake Hocquart, the current follows the course of the Pika River consecutively on to the north, the course of the Pikauba River on north to the confluence with Kenogami Lake; it crosses this lake on north-east to Barrage de Portage-des-Roches; the course of the Chicoutimi River on to the east, then the northeast and the course of the Saguenay River on east to Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.
This toponym evokes the life work of Gilles Hocquart (1694-1783), born in Mortagne-au-Perche (France).
After having been controller of the port of Rochefort, he came in 1729 to settle in Quebec (city), as authorizing commissioner and interim intendant of New France, in order to replace Claude -Thomas Dupuy; he was confirmed in his functions in 1731.
In about twenty years, Gilles Hocquart advanced settlement and agriculture, notably by granting seigneuries in the region of lac Champlain and in Nouvelle-Beauce.
He ensured the completion of chemin du Roi, on the left bank of St. Lawrence River, in addition to encouraging shipbuilding, export development, industrial production at Forges du Saint-Maurice, while maintaining a fairly good balance in public finances.
Returning to France in 1748, he was first, until 1763, steward of the port of Brest and, as such, he remained in contact with the colony by helping several Acadians deported to establishing themselves in France and ensuring the fitting out of ships bound for Quebec (city) during the Seven Years' War.
Gilles Hocquart was appointed State Councilor in 1764 and, until his death, he was entrusted with the stewardship of the Navy classes.
One of his main achievements was the construction of a depot at the Intendant's palace in Quebec (city), where all of the colony's timed registers and documents are stored.
Despite the refusal of the king of France, Gilles Hocquart arranged for this place to keep the official documents of the colony in a safe place.
Several historians of French Canada emphasize that his stubbornness in front of the king would have made it possible to preserve a substantial part of the archives written in the XVIIth and XVIIIth centuries.
The toponym "Lac Hocquart" was formalized on December 5, 1968 by the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

A Rubber Band Christmas
A Rubber Band Christmas is a 1996 instrumental Christmas novelty album featuring traditional and popular Christmas songs played entirely on rubber bands, staplers and other office equipment.
The album is noted for its comic effects and has been described as one of the "weirdest" and most novel releases of its type.
The album came about when two artists, Jeff St. Pierre and Philip Antoniades, found themselves bored one evening at the office and began creating Christmas music out of rubber bands, staplers, tape and other office supplies to hand.
After entertaining themselves through the night with this diversion, they forwarded the results as a "seasonal thank you" to friends and associates.
The recording was sufficiently well received that Artist Development Associates of Framingham, Massachusetts, decided to release it as a CD, under the title "A Rubber Band Christmas", with St. Pierre and Antoniades going by the name "The Rubberband Band".
The CD was re-released on October 24, 2000.
The album's fourteen tracks typically feature a rubber band twanging out the melody, while a ruler struck at different lengths adds a bass accompaniment.
Rhythm is sometimes supplied through the use of "quickly-yanked frosty tape".
The tracks featured are a selection of traditional and popular Christmas carols and ballads, with the word "rubber" substituted at some point in the title, yielding names such as "Rubber Bells" (for Jingle Bells), "Rudolph the Rubber-nosed Reindeer" (Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer) and "Feliz Rubberdad" (Feliz Navidad) etc.
"AllMusic" states that in spite of the unusual instrumentation, the tracks are "still recognizable as—and a whole lot sillier than—the original carols."
The reviewer concludes that while the 14 tracks "may be too much of a good thing", the release constitutes "easily the most novel holiday novelty album in a long while.
It must be heard to be believed."
Scott Frampton of "CMJ New Music Monthly" wrote that the album would have strong appeal to "aficionados of the pop-culturally weird".
Kyle Brown of "Rubber and Plastic News" wrote that "The snaps and twangs aren't always pitch-perfect, but a lot of spirit comes through.
Even the off notes sometimes sound catchy in new and interesting ways."
Canadian broadcaster and columnist MC Gilles included the album at number three in a list of his five top Christmas novelty albums, describing it as "unbearable, but nice."
Brian Boyd of the "Irish Times" included the album at number four on a list of "5 weirdest albums of all time", describing it as "a unique listening experience ...
Criminally out of print, it can only be listened to in [short] intervals" but "you sort of want it in your collection all the same."
Tracks from the album have been featured on both the BBC and on the ABC's Radio National websites, the latter in a "Christmas surprise cracker."

Final
Timeline of the Syrian Civil War (September–December 2019)
The following is a timeline of the Syrian Civil War from September–December 2019.
Information about aggregated casualty counts is found at Casualties of the Syrian Civil War.
In October 2019, Turkey launched Operation Peace Spring amid a U.S. withdrawal.
In response to the Turkish offensive, Russia arranged for negotiations between the Syrian government in Damascus and the Kurdish-led forces.
Russia also negotiated a renewal of a cease-fire between Kurds and Turkey that was about to expire.
The US withdrawal caused major policy debate amongst US officials.
Some officials asserted that they had advised the Kurds for some time to reach some understanding with Turkey.
“We did not give a military guarantee to the Kurds against Turkey...” said James Jeffrey at a hearing on Oct. 22.
“In fact, much of our conversations with the Kurds [was] that you had to find some kind of political accommodation with Turkey because you couldn’t count on us to keep the Turks out militarily.”
Amid the Turkish offensive and U.S. withdrawal, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) commander-in-chief Mazloum Abdi announced that they were ready to partner with Russia and Bashar al-Assad's Syrian government, stating that "... if we have to choose between compromises and the genocide of our people, we will surely choose life for our people."
According to Syrian Kurdish officials, the deal allowed Syrian government forces to take over security in some border areas, but their own administration would maintain control of local institutions.
Syrian troops entered some key towns in northeastern Syria, including Manbij, Tell Tamer, Kobanî, and Ayn Issa, and took up position in some areas to oppose Turkish troops that were threatening various Kurdish forces.
The developments led to Kurdish concern that the independence of their declared Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (NES) in Rojava might be severely curtailed.
On 15 October, Russian forces began patrolling along the contact line between Turkish and Syrian government forces in northeast Syria, filling the security vacuum created by the sudden U.S. withdrawal.
Video footage showed Russian soldiers and journalists touring a base that the U.S. left behind.
Alexander Lavrentiev, Russia's special envoy on Syria, warned that the Turkish offensive into Syria was unacceptable and stated that Russia was seeking to prevent conflict between Turkish and Syrian troops.
Russia and Turkey made an agreement via the Sochi Agreement of 2019 to set up a Second Northern Syria Buffer Zone.
Syrian President Assad expressed full support for the deal, as various terms of the agreement also applied to the Syrian government.
Following the creation of the Second Northern Syria Buffer Zone the SDF stated that it was ready to merge with the Syrian Army if when a political settlement between the Syrian government and the SDF is achieved.
The Syrian Democratic Council said it was ready to have positive discussions with the Assad government.
They said their focus would shift to stopping the Turkish invasion.
On 30 October, the recently-negotiated Syrian Constitutional Committee held its inaugural meeting.
In November 2019, refugees in Northeast Syria reported they had received no help from international aid organizations.
On 20 November 2019, a new Syrian Constitutional Committee, with about 150 members, began discussing a new settlement and to draft a new constitution for Syria.
The committee includes representatives of the Syrian government, opposition groups, and countries serving as guarantors of the process such as Russia.
However, this committee has faced strong opposition from the Syrian government.
50 of the committee members represent the Assad government, and 50 members represent the opposition.
The committee began working in November 2019 in Geneva, under UN auspices.
However, the Syrian government delegation left on the second day of the process.
On 24 November, pro-government forces launched a new Idlib offensive, the largest offensive by the Syrian government in Idlib in more than three months.
Russia and Syria escalated their attacks against rebel forces in Idlib.
This was criticized by the United States and U.S. President Donald Trump issued a warning against violence against civilians in Idlib.
A new international issue emerged when Syrian forces reached the area of various Turkish outposts, and Erdogan said that Turkish forces would not withdraw from any position.
Syrian troops closed in on the town of Maaret al-Numan.
On December 30, 2019, the US launched air strikes in Syria against rebel groups allied with Iran.
It appeared that Turkey was withdrawing all of its forces away from the al-Shirkark silos, which hold important supplies of wheat, this seemed to be a result of Russian mediation.
However, some reports said they later returned to re-occupy that area.
Russia said it would pledge to remove Turkish forces from a key highway in northern Syria, and replace them with Russian forces to maintain stability.
Russian and Turkish forces are continuing their joint patrols.
Questions remained about how much control Turkey has over its proxies, such as the Free Syrian Army.
Turkey has begun to appoint local mayors and governors in several northern Syrian towns.
They have also appointed about 4,000 police officers and other local officials, and are providing some basic local services for citizens.
There are some reports that Turkey has become more involved with local infrastructure in areas that it controls.
Some local schools have been provided with some teachers and curriculum components.
Erdogan said that Turkey expects to resettle about 1 million refugees in that a rea, and called for more support from the EU and from world organizations.
Some protesters in Syria blamed Turkey for the latest Syrian attacks on Idlib.
They claim that the rebel groups posted near Idlib are largely akin to mercenary groups answering to Turkey.
It is unclear whether there is strong evidence for this allegation.
Meanwhile, as Turkey considers sending some elements of these groups to Libya, it heightens such allegations.
A major statement from NGO ACT Alliance found that millions of Syrian refugees remain displaced in countries around Syria.
this includes around 1.5 million refugees in Lebanon.
Also the report found that refugees in camps in north-eastern Syria have tripled this year.
The UNHCR has also been tracking data on refugees, and maintains an official website to do so.
Numerous refugees remain in local refugee camps.
Conditions there are reported to be severe, especially with winter approaching.
4,000 people are housed at the Washokani Camp.
No organizations are assisting them other than the Kurdish Red Cross.
Numerous camp residents have called for assistance from international groups.
Over 120,000 refugees were reported fleeing Idlib governorate.
In December 2019, Erdogan stated that Syrian bombing of Idlib had caused new waves of refugees to enter Turkey,also stated that Turkey could not handle this new influx, and that this influx would be "be "felt by all European countries".
The UN said 235,0000 refugees have fled the area.
Turkey is reaching out to Russia to try to mitigate the situation.
Erdogan said he would ask for Russia's help in limiting the new wave of refugees.
The Syrian Army is continuing to attack, with Russian air support.
Erdogan said that Turkey expects to resettle about 1 million refugees in the "buffer zone" that it controls.
Erdogan claimed that Turkey had spent billions on approximately five million refugees now being housed in Turkey; and called for more funding from wealthier nations and from the EU.
This plan raised concerns among Kurds about displacement of existing communities and groups in that area.
SDF Commander Mazlum Abdi called on the US and Russia to help stop Turkey from displacing entire communities and ethnic groups from the areas that it controls.
Erdogan stated that Turkey was ready to resettle the Syrian refugees in the northern area that Turkey had invaded, and that Turkey would pay for it if necessary.
On 9 December 2019, various local accounts indicated that Turkey was moving Syrian refugees into its zone of operations in Northern Syria for the first time.
Erdogan said that Turkey was working to settle one million people in the cities of Tal Abyad and Ras Al-Ain in northern Syria.
This has led to fears of population change Erdogan claimed that Turkey had spent billions on approximately five million refugees now being housed in Turkey; and also asserted that wealthier nations had done little to address the situation.
This issue caused discussion in Turkish society.
In December 2019, Erdogan stated that Syrian bombing of Idlib had caused new waves of refugees to enter Turkey.
Erdogan stated that Turkey could not handle this new influx, and that this influx would be "be "felt by all European countries".
On December 30, 2019, over 50 Syrian refugees, including 27 children, were welcomed in Ireland, where they started afresh in their new temporary homes at the Mosney Accommodation Centre in Co Meath.
The migrant refugees were pre-interviewed by Irish officials under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP).
As of December 2019, a diplomatic dispute is occurring at the UN over re-authorization of cross-border aid for refugees.
China and Russia oppose the draft resolution that seeks to re-authorize crossing points in Turkey, Iraq, and Jordan; China and Russia, as allies of Assad, seek to close the two crossing points in Iraq and Jordan, and to leave only the two crossing points in Turkey active.
All of the ten individuals representing the non-permanent members of the Security Council stood in the corridor outside of the chamber speaking to the press to state that all four crossing points are crucial and must be renewed.
United Nations official Mark Lowcock is asking the UN to re-authorize cross-border aid to enable aid to continue to reach refugees in Syria.
He says there is no other way to deliver the aid that is needed.
He noted that four million refugees out of the over eleven million refugees who need assistance are being reached through four specific international crossing points.
Lowcock serves as the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator and the Head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.<ref name="UN VOA 12/2019">Margaret Besheer (18 December 2019), "UN: Ability to Get Lifesaving Aid to 4 Million Syrians at Risk".</ref>
Russia, aided by China's support, has vetoed the resolution to retain all four border crossings.
An alternate resolution also did not pass.
The US strongly criticized the vetoes and opposition by Russia and China.
The US Ambassador to the UN, Kelly Craft, said this opposition to these crossings would be "disastrous."
An official statement by the US Government on the State Department website stated this veto was "shameful."
Erdogan said that Turkey expects to resettle about 1 million refugees in the "buffer zone" that it controls.
Erdogan claimed that Turkey had spent billions on approximately five million refugees now being housed in Turkey; and called for more funding from wealthier nations and from the EU.
This plan raised concerns among Kurds about displacement of existing communities and groups in that area.
Russia is taking a leading role in assisting with efforts to rebuild infrastructure in Syria.
In addition to efforts by the Russian government, several Russian companies have begun to take leading roles in economic rebuilding projects as well.
In general positive negotiations have increased between Syria and Turkey, and between Syria and Kurdish groups.
On the ground, Turkish areas of operations had been delineated by Russian mediators.
Russian military officials forged agreements between Syria, Turkey and Kurds for areas to be patrolled by each side.
Russia handles security through its own forces deployed in some key towns.
On 9 December, Russian troops entered Raqqa and began distributing humanitarian aid.
As a result of the Turkish incursion, multiple Kurdish groups that were once rivals have begun to seek greater unity.
Additionally, Syrian Kurdish officials have had some positive discussions with the Assad government, and with local countries such as Saudi Arabia, UAE and Jordan.
Various Kurdish faction that were historical rivals began to meet in order to work together more.
Their stated reason was to stand together against Russia and Turkey more strongly if needed.
The Russian government has informed the Kurdish factions that they should reconcile and come up with a unified set of demands to clarify to Russia.
Various Kurdish factions blamed each other and their council for lack of progress.
The national Syrian government sent representatives to northeast Syria to meet with local groups there in order to address their concerns and to emphasize unity and combined effort to address problems.
A meeting occurred in Qamishli city, in northeast Syria, that included Syrian national officials, and delegates from Kurdish, Arab, and Syrian figures and forces.
Kurdish delegates emphasized their desire to help to protect Syria as a whole.
They expressed willingness to have positive discussions with the Assad government.
Some reports indicated that meetings between officials of the Assad government and leaders of local political factions went well, and all parties agreed on common goals to improve Syrian society as a whole.
The SDF has shown some reluctance to integrate into the Syrian National Army as requested by the Assad government, though.
Luqman Ehmê, spokesman for the North East Syria Autonomous Administration, said that his organization was ready for positive discussions with the Syrian regime.
SDF General Commander Mazlum Abdi has met with local leaders of the Wise Committee, which is composed of leaders of local communities and local family groupings.
This meeting emphasized the importance on national unity, and the need to stand against Turkish invaders.
The M4 road to Aleppo was set to reopen, based on an agreement mediated by Russia with Turkey, Turkey's allies in Syria, and the SDF.
It was reported that the Russian and Turkish armies had made a deal whereby electricity would be supplied to Tal Abyad by Russia's allies, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) who now support Assad; while water would be supplied by the Alouk water station that is controlled by Turkish forces.
This deal was mainly facilitated by Russian military officials.
On 12 December 2019, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that Turkey's northern buffer zone had now "stabilized" the situation in northern Syria.
At a panel discussion on the conflict in December 2019, several experts said the conflict was slowly moving towards resolution.
One expert said that the "Astana" diplomatic process, involving Turkey, Russia, and Iran, was having some positive results.
Experts also said that Bashar Assad had made progress in restoring rule by local councils in areas affected by the conflict.
In December 2019, the EU held an international conference which condemned any suppression of the Kurds, and called for the self-declared Automnomous Administration in Rojava to be preserved and to be reflected in any new Syrian Constitution.
The Kurds are concerned that the independence of their declared Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (NES) in Rojava might be severely curtailed.
The United States announced it will pass major new sanctions against Syria and Russia, as well as Iran, reportedly due to alleged war crimes committed during the civil war.
The US Congress has enacted punitive sanctions on the Syrian government for its actions during the Civil War.
These sanctions would penalize any entities lending support to the Syrian government, and any companies operating in Syria.
US President Donald Trump tried to protect the Turkish President Erdogan from the effect of such sanctions.
Some activists welcomed this legislation.
Some critics noted that these punitive sanctions are likely to backfire or have unintended consequences; i.e., instead of impeding or curtailing the Syrian government, it will increase its authority, as ordinary Syrian people will now have less economic resources due to these sanctions, and will need to rely on the Syrian government and its economic allies and projects even more.
Critics said that such economic sanctions have little realistic chance of promoting real reform and democracy; their impact on the political ruling class will be limited, while they will likely affect ordinary Syrians disproportionately.
Mohammed al-Abdallah, Executive Director of Syria Justice and Accountability Center (SJAC), said that the sanctions will likely hurt ordinary Syrian people, saying, “it is an almost unsolvable unfeasible equation.
If they are imposed, they will indirectly harm the Syrian people, and if they are lifted, they will indirectly revive the Syrian regime;” he attributed the sanctions to “political considerations, as the United States does not have weapons and tools in the Syrian file, and sanctions are its only means.”
Peter Ford, the former UK Ambassador to Syria, said "...going forward, we’re seeing more economic warfare.
It seems that the US, having failed to change the regime in Syria by military force or by proxies, is tightening the economic screws and the main reason why the US is keeping hold of the production facilities in eastern Syria.
So, the economic situation is becoming more and more serious and dire in Syria and it’s a major reason why refugees are not going back.”
In the Kurdish-led Autonomous Administration in Northern and Eastern Syrian (NES) of Rojava, Kurdish opposition parties have refused to re-open their offices.
they have cited a lack of trust in the regional government of Rojava.
Meanwhile, officials of the NES held meetings with local Arab leaders, who stated that Kurdish forces are unfairly detaining women and children from their communities.
At the NATO summit in London in December 2019, President Emmanuel Macron of France highlighted major differences with Turkey over the definition of terrorism, and said there was little chance this aspect of the conflict could be resolved positively.
Macron criticized Turkey strongly for fighting against groups who had been allied with France and the West in fighting terrorism.
Numerous issues in resolving the conflict emerged at the NATO summit in London.
Turkey proposed a safe zone where Syrian refugees could be relocated, but this idea did not receive support from all parties.
Prior to the NATO Summit, there was a meeting at 10 Downing Street of the leaders of France, the UK, Germany and Turkey.
One key point that emerged that the Western countries insisted that refugees could only be relocated voluntarily.
Meanwhile, there were concerns in NATO about Turkey's growing closeness with Russia.
Erdogan claimed that a four-way summit on Syria was scheduled to occur in Turkey in February 2020, to include Turkey, Germany, the UK and France.
At a meeting in Damascus, Russian and Syrian officials clearly stated their support for Syria regaining control over all of its territory.
The United Arab Emirates also expressed official support for Assad.
A new round of meetings for the Astana summit process took place in the Kazakh capital Nur Sultan.
The meeting includes Russia, Syria, Turkey and Iran.
At this meeting Russia, stated that the "safe zone" established by Turkey should not be expanded, as this would not accomplish anything positive for the region.
The Astana process was created by Turkey, Iran and Russia in order to find a lasting solution to the conflict.
they have examined a process to reform the constitution of Syria via the newly-formed Syrian Constitutional Committee.
The parties reported that they reached some important understandings at this meeting, including affirming a commitment to work together to respect Syrian territorial integrity.
The United States has boycotted this process.
At the Astana Process meeting in December 2019, a UN official stated that in order for the third round of talks to proceed, co-chairs from the Assad regime and the opposition need to agree on an agenda.
The committee has two co-chairs, Ahmad Kuzbari representing the Assad regime, and Hadi Albahra from the opposition.
It is unclear if the third round of talks will proceed on a firm schedule, until the Assad regime provides its assent to participate.
The Arab League has offered to allow Syria to rejoin as a member.
They have stipulated two pre-conditions for doing so; firstly, that Syria distance itself from Iran, and, secondly that Syria implement UN Security Council resolution 2254, which calls for the a process to reform the Syrian Constitution, and then to hold an election to end the Syrian conflict.

Apica River
The Apica River is a freshwater tributary of the Pikauba River, flowing in the unorganized territory of Lac-Ministuk, in the Le Fjord-du-Saguenay Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
The Apica River flows through a narrow, steep valley.
Visitors can admire the panorama from a rest area located a few kilometers north of the route 169 bridge over it.
This river turns out to be the outlet of a series of small aligned lakes, located to the south, Lake Micoine constituting its head.
At the end of the route, the Apica river flows at the foot of Apica mountain, culminating at .
The lake of the same name is located to the southwest of Mount-Apica; however, this lake is integrated into the watershed of the rivière aux Écorces.
The upper part of the Apica valley is accessible by the route 169 (route d'Iberville); other secondary forest roads have been developed in the sector for forestry and recreational tourism activities.
Forestry is the primary economic activity in the sector; recreational tourism, second.
The surface of the Apica River is usually frozen from late November to early April, however safe circulation on the ice is generally from mid-December to late March.
The Apica River intersects the route 169 connecting Quebec (city) to Lac Saint-Jean, halfway between Jacques-Cartier Lake and the northwest limit of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve.
The main watersheds adjacent to the Apica River are:
The Apica River rises at the mouth of Lake Micoine (altitude: ).
The mouth which is on the north shore of this head lake is located at:
From the mouth of Lake Micoine, the course of the Apica River flows over entirely in the forest zone, with a drop of , according to the following segments :
The Apica river flows on the west bank of the Pikauba River.
This confluence is located at:
From the confluence of the Apica river with the Pikauba River, the current descends successively the Pikauba river on to the northeast, then the current crosses the Kenogami Lake on north-east to Barrage de Portage-des-Roches, then follows the course of the Chicoutimi River on to the east, then the northeast, and the course of the Saguenay River on east to Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.
The Dictionary of Rivers and Lakes of the Province of Quebec (1914 and 1925) calls this stream "Upika River".
The toponymic designation of this river appears under the spelling "Upica" on the map of the province of Quebec by Eugène Taché (1870), in Studies by Stanislas Drapeau on the developments of the colonization of Lower Canada (1863), and in an 1850 report from the Commissioner of Crown Lands, JH Price, with the spelling "Upika".
The Innu term "upica" means "it is constricted" when speaking of a watercourse.
This term could also mean "carrying strap", according to an interpretation known formerly.
Long used, the name "Upica" was changed in 1961 to "Apica" as was the new designation "Mount Apica".
This mountain then acquired a certain notoriety following the installation, nearby, of a radar station, today disused.
The toponym "Apica river" was formalized on June 6, 1973 at the Place Names Bank of the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church
St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church is a Roman Catholic church in Wake Forest, North Carolina, a suburb of Raleigh.
The first Catholics to settle in Wake Forest were George Bolus and his wife in 1910.
Soon after, the Wilkinson family moved to the area from New Orleans, becoming the second Catholic family in the town.
Catholics who soon after settled in the town had to travel to Raleigh to attend mass.
As more Catholics settled in the area, a traveling priest John A. Beshel, the Chaplain of the Nazareth Orphanage, occasionally celebrated mass in the living room of the home of the Bolus family, using a closet as a confessional.
In 1938 St. Peter's Chapel, a Railroad chapel car built by the Catholic Extension Society of Chicago in 1892, was given to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh to use as a house of worship for Catholics in Wake Forest.
The train car, which included a bedroom and kitchen for the priest, an altar, and sixty seats for congregants, was parked at the Seaboard Railroad by Bishop Eugene J. McGuinness, and was used until February of 1940.
In the 1930s Biship McGuinness' cousin, the papal countess Katherine E. Price, visited Wake Forest and was surprised that the college town did not have a Catholic Church.
She donated a large amount of money for the construction of a church and rectory.
A plot of land was purchased at 701 South Main Street and construction began in 1939.
The architect for the original church was Frank Frimmer of Tampa, Florida.
The Gothic church was built using granite from the nearby town of Rolesville.
The church was dedicated by Bishop McGuinness on February 25, 1940 and named after Catherine of Siena, the patron saint of Price.
In 1947 Father Tevlin, the priest at St. Catherine's, built St. Eugene's Church in Wendell as a daughter parish.
In 1948 John Hyland succeeded Tevlin as priest of St. Catherine's and St. Eugene's.
Hyland, who was the first superior of Bishop Vincent Stanislaus Waters' Missionary Apostolate.
He made Wake Forest the headquarters of the Missionary Fathers from a mobile trailer-chapel called Madonna of the Highways, located near St. Catherine's.
The trailer was dedicated on May 6, 1948 by the Apostolic Delegate Amleto Giovanni Cicognani at the annual convention of the North Carolina Catholic Laymen Association in Wilmington.
On August 14, 1966 a transport tractor trailer struck a power pole and trees along the front side of the church.
A large marble statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was knocked into the church, destroying part of the south wall, foundation, and interior of part of the church.
On September 4, 1977, the parish rectory caught on fire.
On August 27, 1979 lightning struck the church bell tower, severely damaging it.
In May 1987 the pastoral administrative duties were granted to Sister Joanne DiGiovanni of the Sisters of Mercy until a new priest was hired in July of that year.
In 1988 the church purchased 18.625 acres of land near West Holding Avenue for $172,212.50 in order to build a larger facility.
In 1997, new buildings were built on the plot on West Holding, including a parochial school.
In 1999 St. Catherine's founded its second daughter parish, Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Church in Louisburg.
In 2001 St. Catherine's purchased over 20 acres of land west of new property for $800,000, building a new school buildings.
In 2009 the church hired the architect Jim O’Brien and Clancy & Theys construction company to build a 33,000 square foot church in the Romanesque style, with seating for 1,700 people.
The new church cost $9 million to build.

2020 Chilean Primera División
The 2020 Campeonato Nacional, known as Campeonato Nacional AFP PlanVital 2020 for sponsorship reasons, is the 90th season of top-flight football in Chile.
The season started on 24 January 2020.
Universidad Católica are the defending champions, having won the previous tournament.
For this season, and given that the previous season was declared as concluded with no relegations to the Primera B, the Asociación Nacional de Fútbol Profesional (ANFP) approved an expansion of the first tier to 18 teams, with two teams promoted from the second tier joining the 16 teams that competed in the top flight in 2019.
The 18 teams will play each other twice (once at home and once away) for a total of 34 matches.
Qualification for the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana will be awarded to the top seven teams at the end of the season, as well as the Copa Chile champions who will qualify for the Copa Libertadores.
Since there were no relegated teams in the previous season, in this season three teams will be relegated to the second tier: the last-placed team in the standings of the 2020 season, the last-placed team in a relegation table which will be elaborated considering the performance in both the 2019 and 2020 seasons, and the losers of a play-off between the teams placed second-to-last of both tables.
Eighteen teams will take part in the league in this season: the sixteen teams from the previous season, plus the 2019 Primera B champions Santiago Wanderers and Deportes La Serena, winners of the Primera B promotion play-offs.
For this season, a weighted table will be elaborated by computing an average of the points earned per game over this season and the previous one, with the average of points earned in the 2019 season weighted by 60% and the average of points earned in the 2020 season weighted by 40%.
Promoted teams will only have their points in the 2020 season averaged, without weighting.
The team placed last in this table at the end of the season will be relegated, while the team placed second-to-last will qualify for the relegation play-off.

Yummy (Justin Bieber song)
"Yummy" is a song by Canadian singer Justin Bieber.
It was released on January 3, 2020, along with a lyric video through Def Jam Recordings as the lead single from his upcoming fifth studio album, "Changes".
The song is Bieber's first solo single to be released in three years.
Bieber notably joined the video-sharing social networking service TikTok on the day of the song's release.
The song received mixed reviews from music critics, with some praising the song's R&B sound, but dismissing the lyrics.
Bieber received criticism for the song's "excessive promotion".
The song debuted at number two on the US "Billboard" Hot 100, while reaching the top five in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and various other countries; and hitting number one only in New Zealand.
The song's official music video was released on January 4, 2020.
On December 23, 2019, Bieber teased the release by posting a picture of himself in front of a piano accompanied by two posts with the caption "tomorrow".
On the following day, he announced the single via a trailer he uploaded to YouTube that shows him walking through an abandoned gas station.
The trailer also serves as an announcement for his upcoming North American tour starting May 14, 2020, as well as a documentary covering "all different stories".
About the upcoming music, Bieber stated that he feels like "this is different than the previous albums just because of where I'm at in my life".
On the release day of "Yummy", Bieber joined the video-sharing social networking service TikTok and posted a video of himself lip-syncing to the song, and encouraged his fans to do so, as well.
Four days later, Bieber released autographed limited editions of "Yummy", including a cassette, a seven-inch picture disc, six unique CDs and five unique seven-inch vinyl discs, available for only 24 hours.
Bieber released five additional music videos for the song, titled: "Animated Version", "x drew house, Animated Version", "Beliebers React", "Fan Lip Sync" and "Food Fight", and launched an official "Yummy" online game.
"Yummy" is a "straightforward R&B number" that moves along on pop-trap beats.
The song contains a "crisp bass line and plinking keyboards".
Bieber rap-sings the pre-chorus, while he hits his "signature falsetto" in the bridge.
Bryan Rolli of "Forbes" magazine called the chorus "seductive", albeit "meaningless".
The song is considered an ode to Bieber's wife, Hailey Bieber.
In an exclusive interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Bieber admitted that Yummy is about his sex life.
The song received mixed reviews from music critics.
Rania Aniftos of "Billboard" magazine said "Yummy" brings back "the flirtatious Bieber we've missed and been waiting for", describing the chorus as "catchy".
Bryan Rolli, writing for "Forbes", said that Bieber "sings his heart out" on the song and noted although "the lyrics may not invite scholarly analysis ... Bieber sure does sound good singing them".
Rolli concluded calling the song a "win, an inevitable chart smash" and opined that it is "sure to sound even better when 50,000 fans scream it every night on his upcoming tour".
Mikael Wood of "Los Angeles Times" described the song as "a lithe little R&B number that faintly recalls Ginuwine's mid-'90s classic 'Pony' and basically three-and-a-half minutes of PG-13 sex talk seemingly directed at Hailey Baldwin".
He stated that "though it's very cute, 'Yummy' feels awfully lightweight for a single that has as much hanging on it as this one does" and added that the song "loses much of its flavor after only a few spins".
Brad Callas of "Complex" magazine listed "Yummy" amongst the best new music of the week and said Bieber's "pivot back to R&B is refreshing for those who were fans of his slept-on 2013 project, "Journals"".
Callas further remarked that the "silky vocals" is at times reminiscent of Bieber's 2016 collaboration with Post Malone, "Deja Vu".
"NME"s Sam Moore complimented the song's R&B production, but dismissed the lyrics, which he termed as "failed expectations".
He opined that the song's producers opted for "minimalism with their choice of instrumentation, melding airy keys with pop-trap beats with an evident view of creating something as universal as the likes of 'Hotline Bling' and Childish Gambino's 'Feels Like Summer'".
Moore further wrote that Bieber's layered vocals and harmonies are "able to glide along rather effortlessly—it's just a shame he doesn't have more to say with them" and that Bieber's embrace of R&B "isn't a complete turn-off".
"Pitchfork"s Eric Torres criticized the song for being "shamelessly engineered for the truncated attention span of TikTok" and "a bloodless shell of an R&B song crippled by asinine lyrics and a tired, syncopated backdrop".
He further wrote that the song "plateaus as soon as it starts, never inching past the toddler-like repetition of 'yummy-yum' in its chorus".
The Guardian's Alexis Petridis wrote that "Yummy" is "eager to go viral" on TikTok, comparing it to viral songs on the lip-syncing app such as Arizona Zervas's "Roxanne", Ashnikko's "Stupid" and Regard's "Ride It", and that "a generation grown on highly sophisticated, multilayered internet culture can detect bullshit a mile off: this is so nakedly eager to go viral that it almost certainly won't."
Petridis pointed out the "shameless plug for his streetwear brand Drew House", "the cringeworthy use of trap ebonics", "use of baby talk to vaguely gesture at a world of sexual pleasure" and the "chorus seems designed purely for Gen Z-ers in yoga pants to spoon frozen acai into their mouths while miming along to the word 'yummy'".
He concluded by stating Bieber "doesn't need the TikTok virality, but craves its pop-cultural relevance – and that desperation chafes awkwardly against the spiritually grounded marital bliss of his current image".
The music video for "Yummy" was directed by Bardia Zeinali and premiered on January 4, 2020.
In the video, it portrays Bieber with pink hair at a dinner party in a fancy restaurant, eating various colorful food items with the guests.
The video garnered 8.4 million views in its first 24 hours, becoming his second biggest 24-hour debut on the platform out of his 5 lead singles.
In the United States, "Yummy" debuted at number two on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, blocked from the top spot by Roddy Ricch's "The Box", becoming Bieber's second consecutive single as a lead artist to debut at the second spot, following "I Don't Care", which was blocked from the top set by "Old Town Road" by Lil Nas X featuring Billy Ray Cyrus.. "Yummy" proceeded to fall to number ten the following week.
On the UK Singles Chart, the track debuted at number five, becoming his first lead single to not debut in the top 3 of the chart since "One Time" the lead single from his debut EP, My World.
"Yummy" also debuted in the top 10 in Ireland, where it landed at number 8, as well as number 16 in Scotland.
It also debuted in the top 20 of other European countries, going number 7 in the Netherlands, number 10 in Italy and number 15 in Germany.
In Oceania, the song debuted at number 8 in Australia, peaking at number 4.
In New Zealand, it topped the singles chart in its second week.
Bieber received criticism for his "excessive" promotion of "Yummy" during the song's release week, that included release of autographed CD variants, seven different videos for the song, launching an official "Yummy" game, online fan interactions that involved Bieber asking fans to buy the song and Bieber's manager Scooter Braun encouraging fans to mass-purchase the song.
Bieber received backlash for manipulation of streaming services, with many calling it "desperate" and "privileged" attempts at making the song debut at number one on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, after predictions of Roddy Ricch's "The Box" rising to the top spot.
During an Instagram live session, Bieber asked his fans to stream and buy "Yummy" on iTunes, and reposted instructions from a fan titled "How to Get 'Yummy' to #1", detailing how to help the song hit number one on the chart.
Those instructions included buying the song multiple times on Bieber's website and iTunes, creating a Spotify playlist consisting only of "Yummy" and streaming it on repeat at low volume, and having fans outside the US download a VPN app, and set it to the US to inflate Bieber's US streams that contribute to the chart.
However, "Yummy" debuted only at number two on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, blocked from the number-one spot as "The Box" rose to the top spot.

Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript Adaptation
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript adaptation (SICP JS) is an adaptation of the computer science textbook "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (SICP).
It teaches fundamental principles of computer programming, including recursion, abstraction, modularity, and programming language design and implementation.
While the original version of SICP uses the programming language Scheme, this adaptation uses the programming language JavaScript.
The National University of Singapore published draft editions online since 2012, and a first public release on December 13 2019.
As of 2019, the book is continuously updated and improved by the community of its readers.
It has been used in NUS's introductory course in computer science.
As its original, SICP JS focuses on discovering general patterns for solving specific problems, and building software systems that make use of those patterns.
The book describes computer science concepts using Source, a series of sublanguages of JavaScript.
It also uses a virtual register machine and assembler to implement JavaScript interpreters and compilers.
The book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 4.0 License.
SICP JS has been used in the course CS1101S at the National University of Singapore (NUS) since 2012.
While the book focuses on principles, models and abstractions for programming rather than specific programming languages, all examples in the original version are written in the programming language Scheme.
SICP JS uses the language JavaScript instead of Scheme.
Since JavaScript shares its functional core with Scheme, the adaptation is straightforward and literal in most places.
Scheme's homoiconicity is replaced by references to an explicit parser in Chapters 4 and 5.
Source is a series of sublanguages of JavaScript, originally inspired by , Douglas Crockford.
It comprises the languages Source §1, Source §2, Source §3 and Source §4, corresponding to the respective chapters of SICP JS.
Each language is a sublanguage of the next, and designed to contain only features needed by the respective chapter.
These languages are implemented by the Source Academy, a web-based programming environment that features various tools to support the reader of SICP JS.

The formal proposal for establishing an animal sciences university in Bihar was made as part of the "Bihar Agricultural Road Map 2012–2017", the second agriculture road map for Bihar, which was launched by the then President of India Pranab Mukherjee in October 2012.
The roadmap set it as one of its targets that "A new University for Animal Husbadry, Dairy and Fisheries shall be set up in the state."

The university was formed by transferring two colleges, Bihar Veterinary College and Sanjay Gandhi Institute of Dairy Technology, from Bihar Agricultural University, as well as six other institutes transferred from Bihar Agricultural University and Rajendra Agricultural University.
An additional college, the College of Fisheries, Kishanganj, was also to be established.
The college was officially approved two years later, in May 2018 and established in August 2018.
The university became operational in June 2017 with the appointment of its first Vice-Chancellor, Rameshwar Singh, one of four state universities and six private universities established in Bihar in 2017–2018.
The university offers undergraduate, postgraduate, doctoral and diploma degrees in three fields, veterinary science & animal husbandry, dairy technology, and fisheries management.

Royal Irish Regiment of Foot Guards
The Royal Irish Regiment of Foot Guards, or "His Majesty’s Regiment of Guards in Ireland", was a regiment of foot guards first raised in 1662 for service in Ireland.
Part of the Royal Irish Army of Charles II, it was initially garrisoned around Dublin.
During the 1688 Glorious Revolution the Foot Guards under their commanding officer William Dorrington stayed loyal to James II, and fought on the Jacobite side in the Williamite War in Ireland.
After the 1697 Peace of Ryswick and the formal disestablishment of James’s army in exile, the Foot Guards were immediately reconstituted in French service as Dorrington’s Regiment, retaining their red coats and Saint George's Cross standard.
As part of the Irish Brigade they distinguished themselves in a number of campaigns.
Renamed the Regiment Roth after a subsequent colonel, Michael Roth, and later still as the Regiment Walsh, the regiment did not formally disband until 1791.
Charles II issued the order for the regiment's creation in April 1662, soon after the Restoration.
The remainder of the 7,500-strong army formed in Ireland at this point was not formally regimented until the 1670s, and contained many Cromwellian veterans.
Leading Royalist James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormond was given the commission to raise the regiment and authority to appoint junior officers; the experienced Anglo-Irish soldier Sir William Flower was made lieutenant-colonel, while Ormonde’s son Richard Butler, 1st Earl of Arran was gazetted colonel, with captaincy of a company.
Other commissions were given to members of Ormonde's circle such as Sir Nicholas Armorer and Sir John Stephens of Finglas.
The regiment was initially established at 1200 men in 12 companies, plus officers; it also included a chaplain, surgeon, drum-major and 24 drummers along with a piper to the "King's Company".
Many of the rank and file were raised in England, apparently to minimise Cromwellian influence, with further recruits from the ranks of the Irish “Independent Companies”.
Up until 1688 members of the Guards were quartered either in Dublin Castle or in the city gatehouses.
Under Arran, the Guards were employed largely on peacetime duties in Ireland: they were used to suppress a mutiny by other regiments in Carrickfergus in 1666, while in 1673 two companies were ordered to Chester and saw service on board ship during the Third Anglo-Dutch War.
Nevertheless the regiment retained a high prestige: a Major Billingsley recorded that "to be a Major of the Royal Regiment of Guards is better and more honourable than to be a Lieutenant-Colonel of any other regiment", while the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Clarendon, wrote approvingly of their appearance on parade.
For the first twenty years of its history the regiment was almost exclusively Protestant, with most of its officers drawn from the Irish Protestant gentry.
However the 1685 accession of Charles’s Catholic brother James accelerated the recruitment of Catholics, particularly as officers.
James’s associate Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell replaced a number of the rank and file, giving the pretext that “the King would have all his men young and of one size”; veteran lieutenant-colonel Sir Charles Feilding was replaced by William Dorrington, an English Catholic.
Dorrington continued reforming the regiment, though Clarendon criticised him for recruiting at the Catholic shrine St James's Well, feeling it would harm relations with the Catholic community.
Arran died in 1686 and his nephew James, Lord Ossory, later the 2nd Duke of Ormonde was briefly made colonel of the Guards: at the time of the Glorious Revolution, Ormonde switched his allegiance to William of Orange.
He was replaced as colonel by Dorrington and the majority of the regiment stayed loyal to James, although one of its two battalions, sent to England immediately prior to William's landing, was taken prisoner.
The Guards subsequently fought on the Jacobite side in the War in Ireland, including at the Siege of Derry, the Battle of the Boyne and at Aughrim, where their lieutenant-colonel William Mansfield Barker was killed.
Several hundred of their number were among those permitted to leave for France after the Jacobite defeat.
Following their departure, there would be no Irish Guards regiment until the formation of the Irish Guards in 1900.
In France the regiment continued to recruit from among Irish Jacobite exiles, the so-called “Wild Geese”, and saw further service in the Nine Years' War.
The terms of the Peace of Ryswick included the disbandment of James’s former army, but the same day as the Guards regiment was broken up, 27 February 1698, it was immediately reconstituted as Dorrington's Regiment in the French Army.
The regiment continued in French service in several campaigns.
It fought at Malplaquet, Dettingen and Fontenoy.
Dorrington ended his active service in c.1710 and died in 1718; Michael Roth, who had begun service with the Foot Guards as a lieutenant in 1686, became colonel, followed by his son Charles Edward, Comte de Roth, in 1733.
Elements of the regiment returned to Britain during the Jacobite Rising of 1745.
Between 1766 and 1770 the regiment’s colonel was the 9th Earl of Roscommon; its last colonel was Antoine Walsh, also known as the Comte de Walsh-Serrant.
In 1791, following the French Revolution, it was merged into the 92nd Regiment of the French Army.
The latter, today based in Clermont-Ferrand, is considered the last French regiment to descend directly from the regiments of the Irish Brigade.
Throughout most of its existence, even in French service, the regiment was issued with red coats with blue facings.
Its colours, a Saint George's Cross with a central crown surmounted with a crowned lion, reflected its original status as a Guards regiment of the King of England.

St Maurice's Church, Strasbourg
St Maurice's Church () is a Roman Catholic church building located on Place Arnold in the Neustadt district of Strasbourg, France.
It was built during the Annexation of Alsace-Lorraine into the German Empire in the late 19th century.
The construction works of the church started in November 1895 within the framework of the construction of the Neustadt district.
The church was designed by architect Ludwig Becker from Mainz, whose preliminary draft was selected during an architectural competition in 1893.
After several years of construction works, the church was consecrated on 28 May 1899.
It was originally the church of the Catholic garrison of the city.
On 21 February 2013, the church was vandalised by a man who damaged about fifteen statues and laid an Islamic prayer rug and a Qur'an which he had stolen in a mosque.
The man probably suffered from mental illness.
The Gothic Revival church was meant to be visible from far away, like the Protestant Church of St. Paul.
The tall and thin bell tower of St Maurice is 65 meters high and was placed in the several-kilometer-long perspective of Avenue des Vosges and Avenue de la Forêt-Noire which connect Place de Haguenau to Place Arnold.
A statue of Joan of Arc dated 1922 is located to the east of St Maurice's Church.
The statue used to stand at the entrance of the church but was moved after Place Arnold was renovated.
The main altar shows the life of St. Maurice, while the upper crucifix is surrounded by representations of St. Mary and St. John.
In the southern chapel, an altarpiece depicts the Virgin Mary.
The side chapel has a modern artwork made by Sylvie Lander.
All the windows of the church are filled with stained glass.
The organ of the church was made by in 1899.
It has 43 stops and 3 keyboards, as follows:

Maimi von Mirbach
Maimi von Mirbach, full name "Maria Celina Gabrielle Antoinette Freiin von Mirbach" (born April 9, 1899 in Antwerp; died October 8, 1984 in Berlin), was a German cellist and member of the Confessing Church.
Maimi von Mirbach came from an old noble family.
Her father, the merchant Wilhelm Freiherr von Mirbach (1858-1914) was a brother of the Prussian lieutenant general and court official Ernst von Mirbach (1844-1925).
Through her mother Carmen Laura, née von Bary (1876-1938), Maimi von Mirbach was directly related to Cornelio Saavedra, the first president of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata.
In this cosmopolitan and international parental home, she enjoyed a Christian-liberal education with a strong musical orientation.
In 1914, the family had to leave Belgium within 24 hours of the beginning of the First World War, moving to Potsdam.
Shaped by her experience as a member of a minority, Maimi von Mirbach turned early to people who needed help.
Already in the 1920s, she recognized the nationalistic and anti-Semitic development in Germany.
After the Nazi seizure of power, she helped persecuted Jews.
also following the values of the Confessing Church.
She abhorred the racial ideology of the Nazis and, as a cellist, continued to cultivate numerous contacts with Jewish musicians, even though this repeatedly put her in danger.
Maimi von Mirbach helped Fritz Hirschfeld, with whom she played in a private string quartet, escape in 1938.
Hirschfeld, chairman of the Potsdam Labor Court for six years from 1927, was arrested after Kristallnacht and remained in Potsdam police prison for three weeks.
He was only released on the condition that he would leave the country.
The German authorities demanded a Reich Flight Tax of 35,000 Reichsmark and a Jewish property tax of 38,000 Reichsmark.
To raise this sum, Maimi von Mirbach acquired the Hirschfelds' house and property.
His "Aryan" wife Grete stayed in the house free of charge until her death in April 1941.
Maimi von Mirbach gave Fritz Hirschfeld 8,000 Reichsmark in cash for his escape to Holland.
In August 1942, he was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp and finally deported to Auschwitz, after which it is unknown what happened to him.
Maimi von Mirbach visited him several times in the internment camp and gave him food, jewelry, and money.
Von Mirbach hid Jews wanted by the Gestapo in her house several times in order to save them from deportation.
At the end of 1941 she accepted the former music student Gisela Distler-Brendel, a pupil of the composer and piano teacher Ilse Fromm-Michaels, as a lodger.
Gisela Distler-Brendel was a "first-degree half-breed" who was not allowed to study at a university.
She also had a forbidden relationship with a gentile, from whom she expected an illegitimate child.
Maimi von Mirbach kept this relationship secret from the authorities, and was thus guilty of racial disgrace under the Nuremberg Laws.
After 1945, Maimi von Mirbach was subjected to many humiliations and restrictions in the Soviet occupation zone and in the early days of the GDR.
In 1956, she left Potsdam and moved to Berlin-Charlottenburg.
Until her death, she told students about her experiences during the period of National Socialism in schools and youth institutions.
In 2005, the Potsdam Administrative Court dismissed an action brought by Maimi von Mirbach's heirs against the reassignment to Hirschfeld's daughter Aenne Dorothy Scott of the property in Klein Glienicke lawfully acquired by Fritz Hirschfeld and expropriated by the GDR.

Tris(cyanoethyl)phosphine
Tris(cyanoethyl)phosphine is the organophosphorus compound with the formula P(CHCHCN).
It is white solid that is air stable, which is unusual for a trialkylphosphine.
It is prepared by the hydrophosphination of acrylonitrile with phosphine.
The compound has been the subject of much research.
For example, it is an effective reagent for the desulfurization of organic disulfides.
Carole Ann Haswell
Carole Ann Haswell is a British astrophysicist and current Professor of Astrophysics and Head of Astronomy at the Open University.
She is a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.
She has been involved in the detection of several exoplanets, including Barnard's Star b.
Haswell was born in Saltburn-by-the-Sea, North Yorkshire, and grew up in Dormanstown.
Her father worked on an ammonia recovery plant at Imperial Chemical Industries.
She became interested in space as a child, when her father told her about the Apollo astronauts as they gazed at the moon while on Redcar beach.
Although she originally wanted to be an astronaut, she realised at the age of ten that this was impractical.
She attended Huntcliff School where she worked towards her GCE Ordinary Levels.
Whilst a student at Prior Pursglove and Stockton Sixth Form College, Haswell was interested in art, mathematics and physics, and was a fan of the television show "Star Trek".
One of her physics teachers was rumoured to be biased against girls, and despite Haswell achieving the highest grades possible in her A-level exams, refused to write her a reference to study physics at university.
She eventually studied mathematics at the University of Oxford, but wanted to apply mathematics to the real world and became tired of abstract proofs.
Haswell eventually spoke to Donald Blackwell who helped her transfer courses, and enrolled on a physics degree at University College, Oxford.
During her time as an undergraduate student, Haswell was President of the Oxford University Astronomical Society and rowed in the Summer Eights.
Haswell earned her doctorate at the University of Texas at Austin, where she worked on black hole binaries.
She attended the Hubble Space Telescope launch in 1990.
She later joined the Space Telescope Science Institute, where she worked on accretion flow and multi-wavelength observations.
In 1994, Haswell moved to Columbia University, where she worked on black hole X-ray transients and cataclysmic variable stars.
She was made a lecturer at the Barnard College where one of her students was Lauryn Hill.
Haswell moved back to the United Kingdom in 1996 and was made a lecturer at the University of Sussex.
Since 1999, she has been at the Open University, at first still working working on black holes and accreting binary stars and switching to exoplanet research in 2003.
Early work on exoplanets was not well funded, and Haswell has spoken about using second hand Canon camera lenses to make suitable telescopes.
First working on accreting binary stars, and then exoplanets.
In particular, Haswell studies short period exoplanets.
Since 2012 she has led the "Dispersed Matter Planet Project", which involves the analysis of light from nearby stars to identify which host mass-losing planets.
In 2018 Haswell was part of the team that was first to identify a planet around Barnard's Star, the closest single (non-binary) star to Earth, a red dwarf star that is six light years away from Earth.
Using the radial velocity method, the team discovered Barnard's Star b.
The solar system around Barnard's Star touches on the edge of the Oort cloud.
Barnard's Star b has a mass three times that of Earth and orbits Barnard's Star in 233 days.
Haswell has predicted that the planet may have a similar surface temperature to Europa.
In 2019 Haswell used the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) to discover six extraordinarily hot exoplanets (with surface temperatures between 1100 and 1800 °C).
At temperatures this high the atmosphere and surface levels of the planet can be lost, and the materials disperse into a thin sheet of gas.
The gas filters the light from nearby stars, which allowed Haswell and colleagues to study the chemical composition of the atmosphere of the gas sheet.
The planets have masses equivalent to 2.6 times the mass of the Earth with almost half the mass of Jupiter.
Haswell has proposed that these planets could be used to understand the geology of the rocky planets in Earth's solar system.
She is part of the team for CHaracterising ExOPlanets Satellite (CHEOPS), which will examine known exoplanets to improve our understanding of their sizes.
CHEOPS, which features a 35 cm telescope, launched in December 2019.
Haswell has been featured in a Royal Astronomical Society exhibition on women fellows.
She regularly provides expert opinion to the national media and is involved with various outreach programmes through the International Astronomical Union.
Haswell was awarded the Open University Outreach and Public Engagement Award for her work targeted at people with low science capital in Teesside.
Haswell has a daughter.
She is interested in the stock market and has used her understanding of astrophysics to buy and sell stocks.
Haswell's publications include:
Oldknows Factory, Nottingham
The Oldknows Factory is a former lace factory on St Ann's Hill Road, in the city of Nottingham in England.
The factory is formed of two 18th century factories, which have since been joined.
The original purpose of both factories was the manufacture of lace.
It's since been converted to house artist studios, workshops, and offices to rent.
The original structure remains as a Grade II-listed building.
Lata Brandisová
Countess Marie Immaculata Brandisová, also known as Lata Brandisová or Lata von Brandis, (26 June 1895 – 12 May 1981) was a Czech equestrian and the only woman to win the Great Pardubice Steeplechase.
Her victory over the Nazi officers at the 1937 race, seen as a symbol of Czech resistance against Nazi Germany, was celebrated with parades attended by thousands of people.
She is the subject of Richard Askwith's book "Unbreakable: The Woman Who Defied The Nazis In The World’s Most Dangerous Horse Race".
Brandisová was born on 26 June 1895 at Schäffer Castle in Úmonín, Austria-Hungary (now the Czech Republic) to Count Leopold von Brandis and Johanna von Schäffer.
She was a member of an old Tyrolean family that had been ennobled in 1580, but later became impoverished.
Her father, a horse breeder, had served as a lieutenant colonel in the Austrian army.
Her mother was the daughter of Christian Ritter von Schäffer.
Her paternal grandmother, Countess Barbara Kinská, was the sister of Count Oktavian Kinsky, who was one of the founders of the Great Pardubice Steeplechase.
She had a twin sister, Countess Marie Kristýna Brandisová.
In 1897 they moved from Schäffer Castle to a chateau in Řitka owned by her mother.
Brandisová began horseback riding when she was eight years old and grew up attending horse races with her father.
In 1916, at the age of 21, she competed in her first horse race.
During the First World War, her father and brother, Count Nicholas von Brandis, went off to fight.
Her brother was killed in action in Italy.
Much of their property was seized y the government during the war.
After the establishment of Czechoslovakia, the family lost much of their remaining property.
She continued her training at the Prague-Velká Chuchle Racecourse and, in 1921, won her first women's race.
In 1926 her cousin Count Zdenko Radslav Kinský, a nephew of Oktavian, invited her to Orlík Castle to breed Kinsky horses for hurdle racing.
She continued to train as a horse racer at Velká Churchle and Veveří Castle under the coaching of Karel Šmejda.
In 1927 she signed up to race in the Great Pardubice Steeplechase.
Her enlistment in the race caused controversy, and she was faced with protests as the race was seen as too dangerous for a woman.
Petitions were made to the Czechoslovak Jockey Club to have Brandisová removed from the race.
The Jockey Club decided that she would be allowed to race, following advice from the Royal Jockey Club in Great Britain.
The Great Pardubice of 1927 was the first time a woman raced, and the first time a French rider raced (Count Alexandre de la Forest).
Brandisová placed fifth, after falling three times on the race track.
In 1933 she raced in the Great Pardubice on a mare named Norma and placed third.
A year later she placed second, and in 1935 she placed fifth.
In 1937 she raced with Norma in the 56th Great Pardubice.
At this time, there was extreme tension between Czechoslovakia and the neighboring Nazi Germany, with the Czechs fearing an invasion.
Over 40,000 people attended the race, hoping to see a Czech jockey defeat the Germans, who had been consecutive champions in the Great Pardubice over the last few years.
On 17 October 1937, Brandisová became the first woman to win the race, seven lengths ahead of a German rider.
Celebrations culminated with a 10,000 person parade from the racecourse to town square in Pardubice.
The race was not held again until after World War II.
Germany invaded Czechoslavkia in 1939, and Brandisová's estate was seized by the Nazi government.
During the war, she joined the Czech Resistance, providing food for resistance fighters and tending to wounded soldiers during the Liberation of Prague.
After the war, Brandisová raced again in the Grand Parduice, failing to finish in 1947.
After the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1948, she and her sisters moved into cottage in the woods, where they lived in relative poverty throughout the Communist regime.
She died from pneumonia in Reiteregg, Austria on 12 May 1981.

John Mulaney &amp; the Sack Lunch Bunch
John Mulaney & the Sack Lunch Bunch is a children's musical comedy special created by John Mulaney that debuted on Netflix on December 24, 2019.
The show was written by Mulaney and Marika Sawyer and inspired by classic children's television series "Sesame Street", "The Electric Company" and "The Great Space Coaster".
Eli Bolin composed the music, with lyrics from Mulaney and Sawyer.
Performing with Mulaney are 15 child actors and singers, aged 8–13.
Celebrity cameos include Richard Kind, André De Shields, David Byrne, Natasha Lyonne, Annaleigh Ashford, and Jake Gyllenhaal as "Mr.
Music."
The program is a one-hour long variety special that presents itself as one episode of a larger series.
The special consists of several songs, skits, and activities interspersed with scripted segments of Mulaney chatting with the Bunch as well as unscripted interviews with both the children and the adult guest stars about their greatest fears and acting background.
Jake, ostensibly in character as a younger version of Mulaney, sings a song about his grandmother's boyfriend Paul and his many quirks, while wondering why the rest of his family hasn't accepted Paul.
Jonah summarizes a fictional book he has read called "Sascha's Dad Does Drag and the Act Needs Work", a book with a comically frank depiction of drag culture from the perspective of the son of an aging drag queen.
Mulaney plays the producer of a fictional Sony Animation film called "Bamboo 2: Bamboozled" which is being focus grouped by the entire Bunch.
The skit pokes fun at the kids' viewing habits and the tropes of modern western animation.
A father, played by Mulaney, hires a math tutor (André De Shields) to help his son Jonah with algebra.
The Tutor performs an elaborate Dixieland-style jazz number about how not knowing math caused him to lose his eye - however, it turns out to be a shaggy dog story, with his eye being unexpectedly saved at the last minute, and he reveals afterwards that he had simply lost his eye by accident while performing the song.
A transitional scene focused on Googy, supposedly a recurring "Sack Lunch Bunch" character, is interrupted when Mulaney is forced to reveal to the kids that the actor who played Googy passed away, subsequently having a frank conversation about death.
During lunchtime, Orson breaks into song about how he will only ever eat one food: "a plain plate of noodles with a little bit of butter."
Mulaney and Tyler play a chess game and continually try to throw one another off with existential questions and absurd facts.
Suri urges Mulaney to play "restaurant" with her, only for the game to end abruptly when Suri refuses to allow him entry into her imaginary restaurant.
Actor Richard Kind has an unscripted discussion with Ava, Cordelia, and Camille about movies, his career, and their experiences in plays.
Nearly every sentence contains the phrase "girl talk."
Lexi and her friend prepare to put on a skit in front of the guests at her parents' dinner party.
However, when all of the guests talk over the performance, she and her friend (David Byrne) launch into a musical number urging the guests to pay attention and explaining what they planned to do in the skit, including cartwheels, acting out the entirety of "Frozen", and a fake newscast while wearing an enormous blazer.
Zell and Oriah perform a dramatic '80s-inspired power ballad wondering what happens to flowers at night.
Jacob and David Byrne make a papier-mâché volcano despite Byrne's childhood fear of volcanoes.
While Mulaney asks about the Bunch's top New York moments, Alex recalls a time he was in New York and saw a woman (Annaleigh Ashford) crying on the street.
He wonders in song about what would happen if he had gone up to her and asked what was wrong, and imagines the friendship they may have shared if he had done so.
Special guest Mr. Music (Jake Gyllenhaal) attempts to demonstrate how one can make music without instruments.
However Mr. Music, having failed to prepare for his segment, grows increasingly exasperated as the objects around the studio he tries to use as examples fail to make any sound.
The special ends with a final round of interviews with all of the child and adult performers.
While appearing on "Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj", Mulaney described the special as being inspired by other educational children's programs such as "Sesame Street", "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood", "The Electric Company", and even more specifically, shows like "Free to Be... You and Me", and "3-2-1 Contact".
According to "Variety", the special is co-written by Marika Sawyer ("Saturday Night Live") and music composer Eli Bolin ("Sesame Street", "Original Cast Album: Co-Op"), who drew inspiration from musical influences including Burt Bacharach, Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, and Trinidadian calypso legend Mighty Sparrow.
They turned to pieces like Maurice Sendak and Carole King's "Really Rosie", which Mulaney remembered from childhood, and Harry Nilsson's "The Point," which were also fueled by catchy songs and extremely relatable anxieties.
"As a kid, we watched movies like "Little Shop of Horrors" and "Clue", and they didn't seem inappropriate – and I don't think they are," Mulaney says.
"But they had a lot of tension to them."
On November 22, 2019, Mulaney tweeted a poster of "The Sack Lunch Bunch" which was in the style of the artwork for the cast recording album of "A Chorus Line".
On December 12, 2019, Netflix released a teaser in promotion for the special which plays as an homage to Bob Fosse's classic film "All That Jazz".
The teaser opens as an almost shot for shot recreation of the opening of "All That Jazz", with Mulaney dressed all in black playing the role of Roy Scheider's Fosse.
The special has been universally praised, receiving an 95% fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes and has an 87% on Metacritic.
Critic Alan Sepinwall of "Rolling Stone Magazine", wrote "It is, like "Galaxy Quest", or "The Princess Bride", one of those gems that manages to simultaneously parody a genre and be an excellent recreation of it."
Critic Erik Adams, from "The A.V.
Club" gave the special an A rating, writing, "The Sack Lunch Bunch is an unconventional package, but its ingredients are pure John Mulaney".
Richard Roeper of "The Chicago Sun-Times", and John Anderson of "The Wall Street Journal" both praised the special describing it more as "effective conceptual art than a variety show".
Mulaney has suggested in an interview with "Vulture" that he hopes to do another "Sack Lunch Bunch" special, and that he has material that didn't make it into the first one that he hopes to explore in later specials.

Stoddard's poem was translated into Russian by the poet, Aleksey Pleshcheyev and published in the Russian journal "Sem'ia i shkola" ("Family and School") in 1877.
Pleshcheyev described the origin of the poem only as "translated from the English", without crediting Stoddard, the nature of whose contribution was thus lost.
The poem was included in Pleshcheyev's anthology "Snowdrop" (Подснeжник; 1878), where it was found by Tchaikovsky.
When "Legend" is sung by English-speaking choirs, the words used are usually those of Geoffrey Dearmer, who translated Pleschcheyev's Russian text back into English for the "English Carol Book" (1913).
Dearmer himself was only 20 years old when he wrote the words.
While Pleshcheyev's Russian lyrics are a literal translation of Stoddard, and also copy the original rhyming scheme ABCB, Dearmer uses considerable poetic licence and a new rhyming scheme of AABB.
The song is in the key of E minor, but the lack of any accidentals in the melody gives it a modal character.
The original form of the song has a brief piano introduction and coda.
This is retained in the orchestral arrangement.
In the choral arrangement, the introduction is eliminated, and the piano coda is replaced by a choral coda featuring extremely low basses.
The melody of the original version is shown below:

The original version of the music, for solo voice and piano, was published as part of Tchaikovsky's "Songs for Chidren", Op.
54, in 1884.
The orchestra arrangement was made for tenor Dmitri Usatov, who premiered it in April 1884 at the Bolshoi Theatre.
The choral arrangement was premiered by the Chorus of the Imperial Opera under the direction of Fyodor Becker in March 1889.
Both the orchestral and choral arrangements were published in 1890.
The choral arrangement was subsequently performed under Tchaikovsky's direction at the official opening concert of Carnegie Hall in May 1891.
According to the "New York Times" review, it "made a great hit", with the composer being "called out twice after it with great enthusiasm".
An English translation, "When Jesus Christ was yet a child", was made by Geoffrey Dearmer and published in "The English Carol Book" in 1913.
The song was the basis of Anton Arensky's Variations on a Theme by Tchaikovsky, Op.
35a (1894), for string orchestra.

Keep On Chooglin' (song)
"Keep On Chooglin'" is a song written by John Fogerty that was first released as the final song on Creedence Clearwater Revival's 1969 album "Bayou Country".
The song was often used to close Creedence Clearwater Revival concerts and was later covered by several other artists including Fogerty as a solo artist.
The song popularized the neologism "chooglin'."
According to John Fogerty, he began working on "Keep On Chooglin'" (as well as "Born on the Bayou" and "Proud Mary," which also appeared on "Bayou Country") during his time in the US Army Reserves.
He continued working on those songs after his discharge and throughout most of 1968, during which time he came up with the idea to cross-reference the songs as part of a "swamp bayou myth."
John Fogerty biographer Thomas M. Kitts describes "Keep On Chooglin'" as "an energetic rave."
The song builds into a boogie as John Fogerty plays variations on the opening guitar riff and incorporates solos on his harmonica.
John Fogerty claims that some of his guitar playing on "Keep on Chooglin'" is based on the playing of Charlie Christian.
Kitts describes Doug Clifford's drums as "pounding," Stu Cook's bass guitar as "thumping" and Tom Fogerty's rhythm guitar chords as "slashing."
Music writer Steven L. Hamelman praises Clifford's drumming on the song as "a brilliant groove, never wavering."
The song popularized the term "chooglin', which may have been invented by Fogerty."
The lyrics tell the listener that he or she should "keep on chooglin'."
John Fogerty explained the term chooglin' as "what happens when 'you got to ball and have a good time.'"
Similar to Fogerty's explanation, Cook viewed chooglin' as a metaphor for sex.
Lyrics of the song such as "Here comes Louie, works in the sewer, he gonna choogle tonight" imply that chooglin' is especially done by the working class, but other lyrics such as "if you can choose it, who can refuse it, y'all be chooglin' tonight" imply that everyone can choogle.
Clifford described the message to keep on chooglin' as inspirational, "It means keep on going, keep on truckin'.
Things may be bad and look bleak, but believe in yourself, pull up the old bootstraps and get the job done."
According to "Village Voice" critic Robert Christgau, the verb "choogle" "has more to do with vigor than with potency, more to do with simple activity than with sexuality."
"Keep On Chooglin'" has some relationship to "Bootleg," another song from "Bayou Country" in that the singer appears to be a marginalized figure.
The two songs also share similar riffs, and were both designed as "concert ravers."
"Keep On Chooglin'" and "Bootleg" (as well as some other Creedence songs) were both used to demonstrate the similarities between different songs as part of Fogerty's defense in the lawsuit brought against him by Fantasy Records, in which Fantasy claimed that Fogerty's solo song "The Old Man Down the Road" copied the melody from "Run Through the Jungle," a song which Fantasy held the rights to.
"Keep On Chooglin'" also relates to several other songs on "Bayou Country" as one of several songs that maintain an illusion that the band is from the Louisiana backwoods, a group that also includes "Born on the Bayou," "Proud Mary" and "Graveyard Train."
Creedence Clearwater Revival often used "Keep On Chooglin'" as their final song in live concerts.
Although the album version lasted a little under 8 minutes, in concert the song could extend for more than 15 minutes.
Live versions have been included on several Creedence Clearwater Revival live albums, including "Live in Europe", "The Concert" and "Live at Woodstock".
"Keep On Chooglin'" was included on the soundtrack of the 1980 Art Linson film "Where the Buffalo Roam".
John Fogerty has frequently played "Keep On Chooglin'" in his live solo concerts.
Versions have been included on several of his albums, including "The Long Road Home – In Concert" and "", as well as a special edition of "Revival".
The Hammersmith Gorillas covered "Keep On Chooglin'" on their 1999 album "Gorilla Got Me".
Lee Benoit covered it on his 2000 album "Dis 'N' Dat".

Hay-a-Park Gravel Pit
Hay-a-Park Gravel Pit is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, or SSSI, adjacent to the east side of the town of Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, England.
Having been a disused and flooded quarry since the 1970s, it now consists of the large Hay-a-Park Lake and three smaller ponds, besides associated reedbeds, scrub, woodland and grassland.
It was designated as a SSSI in 1995 because it supports a number of wintering birds, including a large flock of goosander.
This site is "one of the most northerly inland breeding populations of reed warbler in Britain."
Hay-a-Park was once part of a royal park, an early landowner being Edward II.
The area once belonged to the Crown; then Edward II gave it to his favourite, Piers Gaveston.
After Gaveston was executed, it passed back to the Crown, but was subject to poaching for some time.
In the 14th century the area was known as "Park de la Haye" where Edward III bred horses.
Edward's fifteen-year-old wife Philippa of Hainault was given this land on the occasion of her marriage; she was later the mother of the Black Prince (whose statue stands in Leeds City Square) and John of Gaunt.
Another story says that in the 11th or 12th century Henry I conferred the lands to Gamel de Scriven, and they remained in the family under various names including Edward II until the last heir, Sir Charles Slingsby, died falling from his horse into the river in 1869, leaving no issue.
The area later became known as "Haya Park".
By the seventeenth century the land was at least partly wooded, and managed for timber.
By the end of that century it was owned by Lady Hewley, who used its rents to support the Church and charities.
When its farmland was valued in 1755 by Robert Moody of York, the land was considered potentially good for cultivation, but contemporary farmers were "poor idle drunken ignorant fellows" who spent Sundays in the alehouse; so that the land was "miserably run and full of weeds," with no prospect of land improvement.
In the 19th century the leasehold of Haya Park was purchased for the purpose of rectorial tithes by York Minster; it was still a royal park, where deer were protected.
Part of Hay-a-Park later became a gravel works, and the site occupies a section which has been "largely undisturbed since the completion of extraction in the early 1970s."
Hay-a-Park Gravel Pit is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), consisting of "standing open water and canals."
This reserve has no parking area, no visitor facilities, and no official public footpaths.
Fishing and swimming are not permitted, and dog-walking is discouraged due to disturbance of water birds.
The site is adjacent to the eastern edge of Knaresborough, accessible by public footpath from two unlabelled entrances on Park Lane, one located near the railway bridge, and the other next to Knaresborough Rugby Club.
The site was first notified on 15 June 1995, being "of interest for its breeding birds and wintering wildfowl."
It is one of about eight SSSIs in the Harrogate region, others being Ripon Parks, Farnham Mires, Hack Fall Wood, Cow Myers, Mar Field Fen, Quarry Moor, and Bishop Monkton Ings.
As described by Natural England in 1995, the site contains the 24-hectare Hay-a-Park Lake at the north end of the site, "three small ponds" at the south end, and "associated areas of reedbed, scrub, mature hedgerow and grassland," however as of 2019 much of the scrub had become woodland.
Of "national importance" are the goosander which winter here, numbering up to 315 birds as counted in 1995.
Of "local importance" are wigeon, greylag, coot and mallard.
In spring, oystercatcher, wigeon and various geese graze on the adjacent field.
Tufted duck, mallard and great crested grebe breed on or near Hay-a-Park Lake, as do common sandpiper and ringed plover.
Grasshopper warbler and sedge warbler breed on the small ponds.
The reed warbler breeds here too, being "one of the most northerly inland breeding populations of reed warbler in Britain."
The fly "Raphium laticorne" has been found in "nine lowland localities" in Yorkshire including at Hay-a-Park, and "Campsicnemus marginatus" has also been found here.
Although the former quarry pit Hay-a-Park Lake may be deep, Natural England recommends that the presence of any shallow water areas be maintained.
This is for the benefit of wintering waders and feeding ducks and geese.
Shallow waters allow aquatic plants to receive light, thereby allowing breeding conditions for dragonflies and damselflies.
"Protection of appropriate water quality" is required, as is regulation of potential incoming water and sediment.
"Bottom feeding coarse fish" must be removed, because they may "uproot plants and disturb sediments."
"Appropriate nesting and feeding conditions are maintained" with regard to open land, scrub and reeded areas.
"Recreational activities should be managed sympathetically to avoid conflict with the management of the waterbody for nature conservation," and "recreational use of woodland should be discouraged" should the site contain a heronry.
A 2012 assessment of the site was "unfavourable, declining."
Notices have been erected at two entrance points of the site, to remind the public that there has been a continuing concern about "illegal fishing" here.
There are also issues of freshwater fish-stocking, public access and disturbance.
A woman was photographed swimming recreationally in the lake in winter 2019, putting greylags to flight.
Some visitors to Hay-a-Park have been carrying out three categories of "operations likely to damage the special interest," namely articles 16a, 27 and 28 of Natural England's views about management of the SSSI.
Nevertheless, the published audit for the Knaresborough Development Plan of 2016 described the site as being available for recreational use, and designated it as an "important community area" (ICA).

SS Fort Camosun
SS "Fort Camosun" was coal-burning 7000-ton freighter, built in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada in 1942.
In June of 1942, during World War 2, she departed Victoria Harbour on her maiden voyage to England with zinc, lead, plywood, timber and other raw materials.
On 20 June 1942 the Japanese submarine I-25, under the command of Commander Meiji Tagami, torpedoed the "Fort Camosun" while she was 70 miles south-southwest of Cape Flattery.
"Fort Camosun" was torpedoed just eleven hours out of port at 11:00pm.
The torpedo hit the number two hold on the port side.
The crew abandoned ship into the remaining good lifeboats.
The submarine then surfaced used deck guns to fire 18 shells at the "Fort Camosun" causing further damage to the ship.
While badly damaged the "Fort Camosun" did not sink, as she was loaded with plywood, timber and other floatable cargo.
The crew radioed for help and later an American Flying Fortress located the crew.
Later in the day the HMCS Edmundston] rescued the 31 crew of the sinking "Fort Camosun".
The "Fort Camosun" was towed to safety by to Neah Bay.
The "Fort Camosun" was low in the water and was towed with the help of the tugboat "Henry Foss" from Tacoma, US Navy tug USS "Tatnuck" and the tugboat "Salvage Queen".
"Fort Camosun" reached Neah Bay, later she was towed to Esquimalt B.C.
At Esquimalt she was put in dry dock and tempory repairs were made.
"Fort Camosun" repaired took timber to England, via Guantanamo and New York.

2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Final
The 2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Final was a beach soccer match which took place on 1 December 2019 at Los Pynandi World Cup Stadium in Luque, Paraguay, to determine the winners of the 2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.
It was the final and hence the last match of the 10th FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, a biennial competition contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA.
As the fourth all-European final (following 2001, 2005 and 2013), the match pitted the European champions of 2018 and 2019 respectively against each other: Italy, who had previously competed in one World Cup final, in 2008, and Portugal, who appeared in their third FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup final and their sixth overall when taking into account the pre-FIFA era "Beach Soccer World Championships"; their last appearance was four years prior in 2015.
In what was seen as an evenly contested affair, Portugal emerged as victors thanks to a series of successful free kicks, clinching the match by six goals to four to win their second FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup crown (following 2015) and third world title overall (including success in the 2001 World Championship), condemning Italy to a second runners-up medal.
The match was also notable as the 583rd and final international beach soccer appearance of Madjer; the Portuguese captain, often hailed as the best player of all-time, announced his retirement immediately following the match.
Italian captain, Francesco Corosiniti, also retired following the match, his 263rd cap.
Both nations are veterans at World Cups, with Portugal missing only one and Italy, two, since their debuts (1997 and 1995 respectively).
The former had had considerably more success than the latter.
During the "World Championships" era, Portugal became champions in 2001 and finished on the podium a further four times (1999, 2002, 2003, 2004).
Since the FIFA era began, Portugal have fared relatively similarly, winning the 2015 title, finishing as runners-up in 2005 and earning bronze medals three times (2008, 2009, 2011).
This was Portugal's third FIFA final and sixth overall.
Italy's best finish of the World Championships was a single bronze medal, in 1996.
Italy reached their first final during the FIFA era in 2008, when they lost to Brazil 5–3, and this remained their only podium finish of this era until now.
This was Italy's second World Cup final.
However, more recently, after neither team qualified for 2013, Italy had reached the semi-finals of the last two editions, one better than their Iberian opponents.
Both teams had enjoyed generally successful seasons but not without some negatives.
As European nations, they had competed in many of the same events.
Portugal failed in qualification for the World Beach Games, but compensated for this disappointment by claiming the gold medal at the European Games and becoming six-time European champions at the Euro Beach Soccer League (EBSL).
Despite reaching this final, they narrowly qualified for the World Cup in July, finishing in the final qualification spot, but also won the silver medal at the Mediterranean Beach Games.
Portugal were world ranked 4th going into the match.
Italy went into the season as reigning European champions having won the 2018 EBSL and began the year by qualifying for the World Beach Games were they went on to lose to Iran in the bronze medal match.
They only managed a fifth place finish at the European Games, but claimed fourth in the EBSL and second place in qualification for the World Cup.
The Mediterranean Beach Games was their most successful event, where they claimed the gold medal.
Italy were world ranked 3rd going into the match.
The teams had gone head-to-head three times previously at World Cups, twice during the World Championships era and once in the FIFA era.
The three meetings are documented below:
The teams had already met on three previous occasions in 2019, with Italy winning two, however Portugal had won the most recent contest.
Before then, the teams had not clashed for over two years.
However, overall, the two teams had met 48 times previously.
The last five meetings are documented in the below table:
Period one began with Portugal on the offensive and Italy on the defensive, the latter's style compared to the "Catenaccio" tactics classically used by their national football team.
Hence the Portuguese were the team creating the goal-scoring opportunities and dominating play, but on six minutes, Italy scored against the run of play – after a shot from Madjer (Portugal's twelfth of the match), Corosiniti played a ball through the middle to Zurlo who slotted home Italy's first shot of the match.
90 seconds later, Chiavaro fouled Leo Martins up against the touchline, just outside the Italian penalty area.
The Portuguese smashed his free kick into the bottom left hand corner to equalise the score.
Portugal continued to dominate, having over 70% possession of the ball, but Italy began creating opportunities of their own as the period neared its end.
After an injury timeout following Corosiniti and Belchior's clash, the period concluded with the score still level at 1–1.
The second period started with a more even spread of chances for both teams.
Del Mestre was forced into good saves from Jordan and then Be Martins, whilst, Gori and Zurlo saw their free kicks go narrowly wide for Italy.
In the sixth minute, the deadlock was broken.
Leo Martins won possession just inside his own half and lead Portugal on a quick counterattack, ultimately squaring the ball to an unmarked Jordan in the middle who fired home at the edge of the box.
30 seconds after the restart, Jordan won a long-range free kick, with his effort saved by a diving Del Mestre.
However, the Italian mistakenly parried the ball back into the centre of the box; with the goal left undefended, Lourenço pounced onto the loose ball for a tap in, putting Portugal up 3–1.
Despite the two goal gap, the game remained balanced as the second half of period two progressed; Leo Martins wasted a great chance, a one-on-one opportunity against the goalkeeper, shooting wide.
Jordan converted a powerful free kick from the centre of the pitch during the opening stages of period three to open up a 4–1 lead for Portugal.
This deficit saw Italy become more offensive to try and bridge the gap.
One minute later, Jordan was guilty of a foul on Gori, conceding a penalty, but the Italian's spot kick attempt was saved by Andrade.
The attacking play of Italy began opening up more spaces for Portugal to exploit.
Soon after, Leo Martins completed a brace from a free kick given away by Marinai just outside the Italian box, extending the Portuguese lead to 5–1 with just eight minutes left on the clock.
Protests surrounding the foul lead to a flurry of yellow cards, for Jordan, Del Mestre and Chiavaro.
After a Corosiniti effort hit the post, Italy scored two goals inside the 31st minute.
First a one-two between Zurlo and Ramacciotti saw the latter slotting past Andrade at close range.
And then from Ramacciotti's corner, Josep Junior ran from deep to head in at the back post for 5–3, reigniting the match as a contest, seeing Portugal take a more cautious approach into the final minutes.
Gori almost made it 5–4 with two minutes left, hitting a bicycle kick against the post, but a controversial foul by Ramacciotti mere seconds later (for which he was booked) allowed Jordan to complete his hat-trick via the free kick.
Italy's remaining efforts proved futile, save for a final attempt by Ramacciotti through Andrade's legs mere seconds from full time.
But the goal bothered Portugal not as they knew they had the game won, and as the last seconds ticked by, the TV cameras were already focused on Madjer on the Portuguese bench who had begun crying.

Portuguese coach, Mário Narciso:
""The games between Portugal and Italy are always very divided.

It was a dream year, we had a lot of victories!
It won't be easy to match.""

""A big hug to all Portuguese, I thank from the bottom of my heart all the support you have given me throughout my career.
I owe a lot to you, I owe a lot to this team, I owe a lot to everyone.
Today was my last game..."" *begins crying* ""...I want to thank all Portuguese, all my colleagues, coaches, all the staff, people who worked with me until today.
To say that I leave happy, fulfilled, proud to be Portuguese, and above all proud of this family that has been building more beautiful beach soccer, with fair play around the world.

List of African-American newspapers in Nevada
This is a list of African-American newspapers that have been published in the state of Nevada.
Nevada was "the last state to remove itself from the list of states that have never had a Black newspaper" in the mid-20th century.
While the late 19th century saw a flourishing African American press in many other Western states and territories, Nevada's African-American population at the time was very low, falling as low as 134 in 1900.
As a result, during that early period, "no Negro-owned newspaper, even of the most ephemeral kind, was published in Nevada."
To be included in this list, a periodical should be mentioned in a reliable source as an African-American newspaper published in Nevada.

Antoine de Ratabon
Antoine [de] Ratabon (1617 – 12 March 1670) was a French aristocrat, who was an arts and architecture administrator during the reign of Louis XIV.
He was Director of the Académie de Peinture et de Sculpture from 1655 to 1670 and Surintendant des Bâtiments (Superintendant of Buildings) from 1656 to 1664.
Ratabon was born in Montpellier, the son of Jean de Ratabon, an equerry, and Catherine Pache from Servien, near Mende.
He became Maître d'Hôtel Ordinaire of King Louis XIV, Trésorier Général de France at Montpellier, and Intendant des Gabelles of Languedoc.
In Paris he became First Assistant to François Sublet de Noyers, who was the Surintendant des Bâtiments under Cardinal Richelieu, and continued in this role under Étienne Le Camus, who succeeded Sublet de Noyers as Surintendant after the latter's dismissal under Cardinal Mazarin in 1643.
Ratabon succeeded Le Camus in 1656.
Ratabon relinquished the post to Jean-Baptiste Colbert on 1 January 1664.
In his role as Surintendant des Bâtiments, Ratabon ordered the demolition of the Hôtel du Petit-Bourbon in October 1660 to make way for the eastward expansion of the Louvre and construction of the Louvre Colonnade.
The order resulted in the eviction without warning of the troupe of Molière from the theatre of the Petit Bourbon and their transfer to the disused and run-down theatre of the Palais-Royal.
By a contract of 1 March 1647, Ratabon married Marie Sanguin, daughter of Nicolas Sanguin, an equerry and sieur de Pierrelaye.
The eight-year-old Louis XIV, his mother Anne d'Autriche, and Cardinal Mazarin were all present and signed the contract.

9th Defense Battalion
The 9th Defense Battalion was a United States Marine Corps defense battalion and was equipped and trained in both defensive and offensive weapons (50 caliber, 20mm, 40mm, 90mm, and 155mm "Long Tom" artillery).
The battalion was sent to the Pacific Theater of Operations and took part in combat operations at Guadalcanal and the Landings on Rendova, the defense of Battle of Munda Point and the Invasion of Guam.
The unit, like all other defense battalions, was renamed in 1944, becoming the 9th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion in September, 1944 and returning to the U.S. in 1946.
Formed during World War II in February, 1942 at Parris Island, South Carolina, the battalion was sent to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in July, 1942.
The battalion consisted of 3 batteries 90 mm AA artillery; 2 batteries 155 mm “Long Tom” seacoast artillery; 3 batteries each 40mm, 20mm and 50 caliber weapons designed as both anti-tank and anti-air artillery.
Together with fire control apparatus, transport, and support units the battalion comprised about 1,300 men.

The battalion setup its weapons at Koli Point, and promptly shot down a dozen enemy planes.
In June 1943 the battalion left Guadalcanal and took part in the Landings on Rendova, set up its artillery and fought off attempts by the Japanese to regain control.
The 155 mm “long toms” shelled Japanese positions of New Georgia and by October the battalion made the move onto the island of New Georgia to defend the Munda Airfield and assist in the
After securing New Georgia the battalion was moved to Mbanika in the Russell Islands for a period of rest and relaxation prior to its next assignment that involved the recapture of Guam in the Marianas Islands.
The battalion landed at Agana, Guam in July, 1944.
On Guam most of the Japanese defenders retreated to the cliffs at the northern end of the island where thousands committed suicide by jumping to their deaths.
The Battalion suffered from very high rates of dengue fever during the Guam campaign and while this was not fatal it did incapacitate many Marines.
Like all other defense battalions in 1944, the unit was re-designated and the 9th was renamed the 9th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion in September, 1944.
The unit remained on Guam for the duration of the war and returned to the U.S. in 1946.

Grizzly Mountain (Canada)
Grizzly Mountain is a mountain summit located in Glacier National Park, in the Hermit Range of the Selkirk Mountains in British Columbia, Canada.
Grizzly Mountain is situated northeast of Revelstoke, and west of Golden.
It is also set north of Cheops Mountain, and west of Rogers Pass from which it can be seen from the Trans-Canada Highway.
The closest peak to Grizzly is Ursus Minor Mountain, to the west-southwest, and its nearest higher peak is Mount Sifton, to the north.
The first ascent of the mountain was made August 31, 1901, by John E. Bushnell, August S. Eggers, Karl Schuluneggar, and Friedrich Michel via the southeast couloir.
The first ascent of the north ridge was made in 1921 by Neal Carter, Tom Fyles, and Don Munday.
The west ridge was first climbed by Georgia Engelhard and Ernest Feuz in 1933.
The mountain's name was adopted in 1906, then re-approved September 8, 1932, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada.
It was so-named because of its proximity above Bear Creek (since renamed Connaught Creek), and in keeping with the bear theme of other nearby features such as Ursus Major Mountain, Ursus Minor Mountain, Bruins Pass, and Balu Pass.
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Grizzly Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.
Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.
Precipitation runoff from the mountain and meltwater from a small unnamed glacier on its northwest slope drains into tributaries of the Beaver River and Illecillewaet River.
2019–20 Naisten Liiga season
The 2019–20 Naisten Liiga season is the thirty-seventh season of the Naisten Liiga, the premier level of women's ice hockey in Finland, since the league’s establishment in 1982.
The season format designated for the 2019–20 season was a modified version of the format established for the 2018–19 season.
While the opening series remained unchanged, the divisional series was expanded to six teams in each division.
In order to fill the two empty slots of the Lower Division, two teams from the Naisten Mestis were added to the Liiga for the divisional series and onward.
The playoff format was modified to account for the increased number of teams; eight teams would qualify for the playoffs rather than the previous six.
This change allowed for a traditional single-elimination tournament to be played from the quarterfinal stage rather than having the top two teams automatically progress to the semifinal round.
Preliminary series
The preliminary series () is played as a double round-robin plus a two-game Opening Weekend Tournament; each of the ten teams plays a total of twenty matches.
Points are awarded by match outcome, regulation wins earn three points, overtime wins earn 2 points, overtime losses earn 1 point, and no points are awarded for regulation losses.
The points earned in the opening series determine which division a team will be sorted for the continuation of the season.
Divisional series
In the divisional series, the teams are grouped into two divisions of six teams.
Each division is played as a double round-robin, each team plays a total of ten games.
The top six ranked teams in the preliminary series qualify for the Upper Division ().
Upper Division teams are guaranteed placement in the playoffs; the points earned in the ten divisional series games are added to the points totals from the preliminary series and used to establish the teams' playoff berths, from first to sixth.
The bottom four teams in the opening series move on to the Lower Division (), where they are joined by the top two teams from the Cross-Qualifiers () of the Naisten Mestis, the league directly below Naisten Liiga.
The Lower Division teams compete for the seventh and eighth seed positions in the playoffs; only the top two ranked teams from the Lower Division earn places in the playoffs.
Unlike the in Upper Division, all Lower Division teams start the divisional series with zero points, only points earned in the series are considered when the teams are ranked.
Qualifying series
The Lower Division teams ranked third through sixth continue on to the qualifying series ().
The points earned in the six qualifying series games are added to the points totals from the Lower Division divisional series.
The two teams with the highest point totals qualify for the 2020–21 Naisten Liiga season, the two lower ranked teams are relegated to the Naisten Mestis for the following season.
Teams promoted from the Naisten Mestis to the Lower Division
Series was played from 7 September to 24 November 2019.
Top six teams advanced to the Upper Division (), while teams ranking sixth through tenth progressed to the Lower Division ().

Oola Castle
Oola Castle is a tower house located in County Limerick, Ireland.
Oola Castle is located east of the village of Oola.
It lies in the Golden Vale, southeast of Limerick.
It should not be confused with the castle in Ballyneety nearby, which is sometimes called "Oola Castle."
The current building dates to the late 16th century and was built by the O'Briens.
It is classified as a "later" tower house; according to Claire Foley and Colm Donnelly, "greater provision of heat and light, married to Renaissance concepts of symmetry, was incorporated into the traditional building form to create a new tower-house paradigm, as expressed at buildings such as Oola [Castle]."
In 1825, antlers of the Irish elk were discovered; and, in 1828, a bronze trumpet, spear and arrow heads of bronze were found.
Both were placed in the museum of Trinity College, Dublin.
A local legend concerns a princess named Theresa who lived in the castle in the 18th century; she was very fond of oranges and was later forced to move to County Cavan for unclear reasons.
The castle is a square six-storey limestone tower house.
There are circular bartizans on the northeast and southwest corners.
The upper windows have hood moulding, and the east and west walls have their original fireplaces.
When it was in use, it would have had whitewashed walls, gables crowned with chimneys and mullioned windows.
1986–87 FDGB-Pokal
The 1986–87 FDGB-Pokal was the 36th edition of the East German Cup.

Anna Amtmann
Anna Amtmann is a Professor for Molecular Plant Physiology at the University of Glasgow.
She serves as Editor-in-Chief of the journal "Plant, Cell & Environment".
Amtmann studied mathematics and biology at the University of Paris and Heidelberg University.
She was an Erasmus Programme student at the University of Barcelona.
Amtmann completed her graduate degrees in biology in the laboratory of at the University of Göttingen.
Her doctoral research involved the use of electrophysiology to study unicellular marine algae, in an effort to understand how they maintain homeostasis for calcium and sodium ions.
In 1993, after earning her PhD, Amtmann investigated ion transport properties in barley in Dale Sanders' laboratory at the University of York.
Whilst at York she developed microarrays that could be used to monitor how ion transporters responded to nutrient deficiency and salinity.
Amtmann was appointed a lecturer at the University of Glasgow in 2001 and was promoted to Professor in 2014.
She spent 2007 on sabbatical at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Golm.
Her research considers the mechanisms by which plants adapt to nutrient deficiency, drought and salinity.
She has explored how solar-powered microorganisms could be used to extra salt from seawater.
Salt is toxic in seawater because it causes dehydration in cells and can distort the shape of proteins.
Marine organisms have developed strategies to avoid toxicity, and Amtmann looks to identify these organisms, fit them with molecular engines and encourage them to take up salt until they are saturated with salt.
The salt-packed cells will die and can be removed from the system, leaving fresh water and a waste product that can be used for bio-cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.
Amtmann's research has been supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.
She leads "Algae UK", one of six Networks in Industrial Biotechnology and Bioenergy (NIBBs) that look to support the UK's transition to a low carbon economy.
Algae UK looks to increase research and development into high value products created from microalgae and macroalgae, as well as increasing attention to cyanobacterial synthetic biology.
Amtmann is the editor-in-chief of "Plant, Cell & Environment".
Amtmann is married to Pawel Herzyk, who she met during her first postdoctoral position at the University of York.
Together they have twin boys.

Køpi
Køpi (also known as Köpi or Koepi) is a housing project (German: "Hausprojekt") located at 137 Köpenicker Straße in Mitte, Berlin.
It was squatted in 1990 and legalised in 1991 as an autonomous housing project and self-managed social centre.
The yard was used as a "wagenplatz" for people living in vehicles.
It is a left-wing project, connected to punks, anarchists and Autonomen.
The building has become a symbol for the radical left in Berlin in the same manner as Rozbrat in Poznań or Ungdomshuset in Copenhagen.
It has survived several eviction attempts both through political pressure and because the developers have always run out of money.
The building was constructed in 1905 for a Jewish businessman.
A symmetrical Gründerzeit facade stands flanked by two short wings.
What can be seen from the street used to be the back of the building, since the front half was destroyed by bombing at the end of World War II and was never rebuilt.
The surfaces of the building are damaged from the bombs and subsequent neglect, with most of the stucco gone.
During World War II, the building was used by the Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft (the general electricity company) to house French forced labourers.
After the war, the building lay in East Berlin.
Under the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the building was used for sports activities and there was a bowling alley in the basement.
By 1990, it had become vacant and was scheduled to be demolished.
Køpi was squatted on February 23, 1990, by Autonomen from West Berlin.
Despite the terrible state of the building, the squatters were attracted by the large rooms.
The police did not attempt to evict the occupation, which marked the first time people from West Berlin had squatted in East Berlin.
The squatters legalised their occupation with the district council of Mitte in 1991.
From the very beginning, Køpi was a radical left space where anarchists, socialists, queers and musicians were welcome.
The building itself is covered in banners and graffiti.
It became known as Køpi because the squatters chose to use the Danish "ø" despite the name coming from the name of the street (Köpenicker Straße).
Køpi is also spelt Koepi, Köpi and even occasionally Kopi in English or Spanish texts.
Køpi has become a important symbol for the radical left in Berlin, linked to projects elsewhere such as the Ungdomshuset in Copenhagen and Rozbrat in Poznań.
The building was owned by the GDR and then by the state which succeeded it.
In 1995, the government sold the building to Volquard Petersen, who wished to develop the site into the Sun Courtyards (German: "Sonnenhöf").
He then ran out of money and the project was shelved.
Petersen fell into debt with the Commerzbank and the building was foreclosed.
In 1999, the district of Mitte carried out a forced auction.
The auction was unsuccessful with none of almost 30 participants offering to buy the property, which had an estimated value of 5.4 million marks.
The offer of Køpi residents to buy the building for one mark was rejected, alongside their request for the terrain to be declared a 'special use site for experimental living' (German: "Sondernutzungsfläche für experimentelles Wohnen").
In the meantime, the residents carried out essential repairs such as plumbing and preferred not to repair the facade, since they wanted to remember the chequered history of the building.
They also carried out many political actions designed to ensure their survival in the house and this made the building unattractive to investors.
For example, when another auction of the building was held in 2007, outside the courtroom there were 300 supporters of Køpi and also 300 hundred police officers.
Beforehand, the police had voiced concerns about violence, warning that the political situation was already tense after a solidarity demonstration for Ungdomshuset.
The auction was this time successful, the building being sold for €835,000 (half the estimated market value) to an agent of the new owner called Besnik Fichtner, an Albanian managing director of the company Plutonium 114.
He also bought two neighbouring properties for €900,000.
The actual new owner was the company Novum Köpenicker Straße 133-138 GmbH.
Other sources reported the new owner as the previously unknown company VKB GmbH & Co. KG.
The Versicherungskammer Bayern in Münich and the Volkskreditbank in Linz were forced to deny they had anything to do with the company, despite having the same initials as it.
Køpi was immediately threatened with eviction.
After one week, the Køpi residents had uncovered a paper trail leading to Berlin-based real estate developer Siegfried Nehls.
They visited Nehls' parents unannounced and his father invited them to drink tea before Nehls' brother called the police.
After one month, the police raided Nehls' headquarters (named as Vitalis Beteiligungsgesellschaft für Altbauten mbH) and twenty other properties, investigating financial irregularities.
By 2008, Fichtner had fallen out with Nehls and signed a 30 year rental contract with the inhabitants of Køpi.
There had been no actual signed agreement between Plutonium 114 and Nehls, so Fichtner was entitled to make a contract.
However, Fichtner then fell into debt and Commerzbank again called for a forced auction of Køpi in 2013.
There were also several auctions related to the "wagenplatz", which was not covered by the new rental agreement.
There were 50 people living in the house in 2016 and 50 in the "wagenplatz", a yard next to the house where people lived in vehicles and wagons.
In addition to being a housing project, the building hosted a variety of activities, including a bar, vegan café, concert venue, cinema, infoshop, gym, printing workshop, rehearsal space and a climbing wall.
The project is run by a weekly plenary which takes place on Sundays.
Only inhabitants of Köpi and members of projects using the space are allowed to attend.
No mobile phones are permitted.
A report by the Senate Department of Internal Affairs and the police in 2017 stated that "in general, it can be determined that the object Köpi 137 serves both as a retreat for left-motivated criminals and as a starting point for crimes."
In response, a Køpi spokesperson stated that "the presence of police on our site is often met with hostility, the parking of tourist buses and structural changes in the area are perceived as an expression of gentrification processes.
Displeasure about these things occasionally results in criminally relevant actions."

Marilyn Saviola
Marilyn E. Saviola (July 13, 1945 – November 23, 2019) was an American disability rights activist, executive director of the Center for the Independence of the Disabled in New York from 1983 to 1999, and vice president of Independence Care System after 2000.
Saviola, a polio survivor from Manhattan, New York, is known nationally within the disability rights movement for her advocacy for people with disabilities and had accepted many awards and honors for her work.
On July 13, 1945, Saviola was born in Manhattan at the New York Hospital.
Her parents, Peter Saviola and Camilla 'Millie' Saviola, who had no other children, were Italian immigrants who ran a candy shop/luncheonette in the Bronx.
In August 1955, a few weeks after her tenth birthday, Saviola contracted polio.
She was hospitalized at Willard Parker Hospital, a communicable disease hospital, and placed in an iron lung for two months.
The polio caused her quadriplegia; she used a wheelchair and a ventilator.
Because her family's home was not accessible, Saviola lived at Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island during her teen years.
Saviola was part of creating the hospital's ward for young adult patients, with more age-appropriate routines, activities and outings.
She attended Long Island University, earning a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1970.
For her freshman year, she and another Goldwater patient attended classes remotely, by telephone, and took tests by mail, an arrangement "believed to be the first of its kind used in a hospital in the state".
She later earned a master's degree in rehabilitation counseling from New York University.
She met activist Judy Heumann at LIU, where they were both students.
Saviola was a rehabilitation counselor for 11 years at Goldwater Memorial Hospital in the 1970s and early 1980s.
While working at Goldwater Memorial, Saviola assisted individuals with severe physical disabilities and helped them with transitioning from living in the hospital to living in the community.
She was executive director of the Center for the Independence of the Disabled in New York from 1983 to 1998, and vice president of Independence Care System after 2000.
She chaired the Manhattan Borough Disability Advisory Group, and served on the boards of the Association of Independent Living Centers in New York, Disabled in Action, and the New York City Medicaid Managed Care Task Force.
Saviola worked for state legislation to support community living and independence for disabled New Yorkers.
Saviola had particular interest in disabled women's rights and health issues.
In 1979, she spoke at one of the first conferences on disabled women's lives, sponsored by the New York City Commission on the Status of Women and the Mayor's Office for the Handicapped.
Her fellow speakers included disability rights activists Sandra Schnur, Maria Nardone, and Frieda Zames.
Her advocacy work was credited in 2019 at the opening of a new radiology unit at NYC Health + Hospitals' Morrisania location in the Bronx, which featured accessible examination tables and mammography equipment.
In 2015, she received the Henry Viscardi Achievement Award for her lifetime of work in disability rights and in 2017, the New York State Disability Rights Hall of Fame inducted Saviola as part of their inaugural class of inductees.
On November 23, 2019, Saviola died at her home in Brooklyn at age 74 years.
At the time Robert Geraghty was her long-term partner.
An oral history interview with Saviola, about her life and activism, was recorded in 2001, is archived with the Disability Rights and Independent Living Movement (DRILM) Oral History Project at the Bancroft Library in Berkeley, California.

Murder of Artemus Ogletree
On January 5, 1935, a man who had given his name as Roland T. Owen, later identified as Artemus Ogletree, died at a hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, United States, of beating and stabbing injuries.
His death was preceded by a two-day stay in Room 1046 at the Hotel President in the city's Power & Light District marked by communication with someone named "Don", and unusual behavior and incidents noted by the hotel's staff, before he was found wounded in his room the morning of his death.
When no next of kin could be located, leading to suspicions that his name was an alias, his body was stored in a local funeral parlor for almost two months.
A planned burial in the city's potter's field was averted when an anonymous donor provided funds for a funeral and a floral arrangement signed "Louise".
The man's true identity remained unknown for a year and a half until Ruby Ogletree, an Alabama woman who had seen a photo of a distinctive scar on his head in the news, identified him as her son Artemus.
She said he had left Birmingham in 1934 at the age of 17 to hitchhike to California.
Later she received two letters purportedly from him, some from as far away as Egypt.
In August 1935 a caller claiming to be from Memphis, Tennessee, told her that Artemus was in Cairo.
The letters had also been sent after Artemus's death.
Records kept by shipping companies found no records that Ogletree had gone to Egypt.
No other suspect has ever been identified.
The letters later were used to link the killing to a 1937 murder in New York, but no charges were filed against the man arrested in that case, one of whose aliases had been "Donald Kelso".
The FBI later investigated but was unable to produce any new leads.
In 2012, a historian at the Kansas City Public Library wrote two posts on the library's blog about the case.
At the end of the last one he revealed that in 2003 or 2004, he had taken a call from someone out of state related to the case.
The caller said that they had been helping to inventory the belongings of a recently deceased elderly person when they found a box with newspaper clippings about the Ogletree case and an item mentioned repeatedly in the stories, but they refused to say what that item was.
The Kansas City police continue to investigate.
Artemus Ogletree was born in Florida in 1915, one of three children.
During his childhood an accident with some hot grease left a sizable scar on his head above his ear, which remained hairless afterward.
In 1934 he left his family, by then living in Birmingham, Alabama, to hitchhike to California.
He kept them updated on his progress by mail; they wired him money.
Early on the afternoon of January 2, 1935, Ogletree walked into the Hotel President, in the Power & Light District of Kansas City, Missouri, and asked for an interior room several floors up, giving his name as Roland T. Owen, with a Los Angeles address.
Staff remembered him as dressed well and wearing a dark overcoat; he brought no bags with him.
Ogletree paid for one night.
The staff noted that in addition to the visible scar on his temple, he had cauliflower ear, and concluded he was probably a boxer or professional wrestler.
They believed him to be in his early 20s.
Randolph Propst, a bellhop, accompanied Ogletree up in the elevator to the 10th floor.
On the way, Ogletree told him that he had spent the previous night at the nearby Muehlebach Hotel but found the $5 ($ in current dollars) nightly rate too high.
Propst opened Room 1046, which per the guest's request was on the inside, overlooking the hotel's courtyard rather than the street outside.
He watched as Ogletree took a hairbrush, comb and toothpaste from his overcoat pocket, the extent of his unpacking.
After Ogletree put those items above the sink, he and Propst left the room.
The bellboy returned to lock it, and gave Ogletree the key.
After returning to the lobby, he saw Ogletree leave the hotel.
A short time afterward, Mary Soptic, one of the hotel maids, returned from a day off to work the afternoon shift.
She went into Room 1046 and was surprised to find Ogletree there, since the previous night a woman had been in the room.
She apologized, but he said she could go ahead and clean the room.
While she did, she noticed that he had the shades drawn and left only one dim lamp on.
This would remain the case when she encountered Ogletree in the room on other occasions during his stay.
"He was either worried about something or afraid" in addition to this preference for low light, she told police later.
After she had been cleaning for a few minutes, Ogletree put his overcoat on and brushed his hair.
He then left, but asked her to leave the room unlocked as he was expecting some friends in a few minutes.
Soptic did as he asked.
At 4 p.m., she returned to the room with freshly laundered towels.
Inside, the room was dark.
She saw Ogletree lying on the bed, fully dressed.
Visible in the light from the hallway was a note on his bedside table that read "Don: I will be back in fifteen minutes.
Wait".
The next morning, Soptic returned to Room 1046 around 10:30.
The door was locked, which led her to assume that Ogletree was out since it could only be locked from the outside, but when she opened it with her own key Ogletree was present, sitting in the dark just where he had been the previous afternoon.
The phone rang and he answered it.
"No, Don, I don't want to eat.
I am not hungry.
I just had breakfast ... No, I am not hungry", he said.
Still holding the phone, Ogletree asked Soptic about her job as she cleaned.
He wanted to know if she was responsible for the entire floor, and if the President was residential.
He repeated his complaint about the Muehlebach's exorbitant rates, after which she finished cleaning, and left.
Again at 4 p.m., Soptic returned with fresh towels.
Inside Room 1046, she could hear two men talking, so she knocked.
A voice she described as loud and deep, probably not Ogletree's, asked who it was.
She responded that she had brought fresh towels, to which the voice said "We don't need any".
Yet Soptic knew there were no towels in the room, as she had taken them herself in the morning.
Two hours later, Jean Owen of Lee's Summit, near Kansas City, checked into the President after having shopped in the city for a few hours.
Feeling sick, she had decided not to drive back home that night.
She was given Room 1048; her boyfriend, who worked in a flower shop in the city, came to visit her there at 9:20 p.m. and stayed for two hours.
Later that night, she told police, she heard men and women talking loudly and profanely all over the floor.
Owen was not the only person to note unusual late night activity on the President's 10th floor.
Elevator operator Charles Blocher, who began his shift at midnight, reported later that he was fairly busy until 1:30 a.m. After that time, most of the hotel quieted down for the night, except for a loud party in Room 1055.
Blocher recalled one visitor in particular, a woman he had seen at the hotel visiting male guests in their rooms on other occasions and thus believed to be a prostitute, a conclusion shared by other hotel staff who were familiar with her.
She came in first sometime during his first three hours; he took her to the 10th floor where she asked about Room 1026.
Five minutes later, the elevator was summoned there again; it turned out to be the same woman, who expressed puzzlement that her client was not in Room 1046 since, she said, he had called her and on previous visits with him he had always been present.
She wondered if, in fact, he was in Room 1024 since she could see through the room's transom window that the light was on in there.
She remained on the floor after the conversation.
A half-hour later, Blocher got another signal to take the elevator back to the 10th floor.
The woman was waiting again and he took her down to the lobby.
An hour later he took her, and a different man, to the 9th floor.
At 4:15 a.m., a call from that floor turned out to be the woman; he took her to the lobby and she left the hotel for the night.
Another call to the 9th floor 15 minutes later turned out to be the man who had come up with her.
He told Blocher he could not sleep and was going out for a walk.
Whether these activities are related to the Ogletree case has not been established.
He may not have been at the hotel earlier that night.
At 11 p.m. Robert Lane, a city worker driving on 13th Street near Lydia Avenue, saw a man dressed in only an undershirt, pants and shoes run into his path and flag him down.
When Lane stopped, the man apologized, saying he had taken Lane's car for a taxi.
The man asked Lane if he could take him to somewhere he might be able to get a taxi.
Lane agreed and let the man in.
"You look as if you've been in it bad", he observed; the man swore he would kill someone else tomorrow, presumably in retaliation for whatever had been done to him.
In the mirror Lane saw a deep scratch on the man's arm; he also noticed that he was cupping his arm, possibly to catch blood from a more severe wound.
At the nearby intersection of 12th Street and Troost Avenue, where taxi drivers often waited for fares during the overnight hours, Lane stopped and let the man out.
The man thanked him, got out, and honked the horn of a taxi parked nearby, drawing the driver from a nearby restaurant, after which Lane drove away.
After Ogletree's death, Lane went to view the body.
He saw the same scratch on the arm and went to the police, telling them he believed Ogletree had been the man he picked up.
At 7 a.m., a new switchboard operator, Della Ferguson, came on shift.
She was preparing to make a requested wakeup call to Room 1046 when she noticed a light indicating that the phone there was off the hook.
Propst, who had led Ogletree there two days earlier, was on shift again and drew the assignment.
The door to Room 1046 was locked, with a "Do Not Disturb" sign hanging from the doorknob.
After several loud knocks, a voice from inside told him to enter; however he could not as the door had been locked.
The same voice told him, after another knock, to turn on the lights, but he still could not enter.
Finally, Propst just shouted through the door to hang the phone up, and left.
Propst told Ferguson that the guest in Room 1046 was probably drunk and she should wait another hour.
At 8:30 a.m., the phone had still not been hung up.
Another bellboy, Harold Pike, was sent to the 10th floor.
The "Do Not Disturb" sign was still on the door, and it was still locked, but Pike had a key and let himself in.
Inside he found Ogletree in the dark, lying on the bed naked, apparently drunk.
The light from the hallway showed some dark spots on the bedding, but rather than turn on the room light Pike went to the telephone stand, where he saw the phone had been knocked to the floor.
He put it back on the stand, replacing the handset.
Shortly after 10:30 a.m., another operator reported that the phone in Room 1046 was once again off the hook.
Again Propst was sent to the room to see what was going on; the "Do Not Disturb" sign remained on the knob.
This time he had a key, and after his knocks drew no response, he opened the door and found Ogletree on his knees and elbows two feet (60 cm) away, his head bloodied.
Propst turned the light on, put the phone back on the hook, and then noticed blood on the walls of both the main room and bathroom, as well as on the bed itself.
Propst went downstairs immediately for help.
He returned with the assistant manager, but when they did they could only open the door six inches (15 cm), as Ogletree had in the interim fallen on the floor.
Eventually Ogletree got up and when the two hotel employees were able to enter the room, he went and sat on the edge of the bathtub.
The assistant manager called the police; they were joined by Dr. Harold Flanders of Kansas City General Hospital.
Ogletree had been bound with cord around his neck, wrists, and ankles.
His neck had further bruising, suggesting someone had been attempting to strangle him.
He had been stabbed more than once in the chest above the heart; one of these wounds had punctured his lung.
Blows to his head had left him with a skull fracture on the right side.
In addition to the blood Propst had seen, there was some additional spatter on the ceiling.
Dr. Flanders cut the cords from Ogletree's wrist and asked him who had done this to him.
"Nobody", Ogletree answered.
Asked, then, what had caused these injuries, he said he had fallen and hit his head on the bathtub.
The doctor asked if he had been trying to kill himself.
After saying no, Ogletree lost consciousness and was taken to the hospital.
He was completely comatose by the time he arrived and died shortly after midnight on January 5.
The Kansas City Police Department (KCPD) began investigating immediately by interviewing Jean Owen, whose identical last name and proximity to the dead man overnight struck them as interesting.
They detained her while she told them what she had heard the night before.
After her boyfriend came to the police station and corroborated her account, she was released and returned to Lee's Summit.
Doctors performed an autopsy on Ogletree and determined he had died from his wounds.
Dr. Flanders had examined not just the body but the bloodstains in the room.
Since much of it had dried by the time he had arrived, he estimated the wounds had been inflicted between 4 and 5 a.m. that day, consistent with what Pike had seen and before Propst's first visit.
Detectives searching Room 1046 took note as much of what they did "not" find as what they did.
Consistent with what Propst had observed, there were no clothes in the closets or drawers.
The only evidence of anything other than what Ogletree had been wearing was the tag of a necktie, indicating it had been made by a New Jersey company.
Also missing from the room were the soap, shampoo, and towels provided by the hotel to every room.
There were no knives, which led to the dismissal of suicide as a cause of Ogletree's death since the stab wounds in his chest could not be accounted for; the cords tying him up also suggested the involvement of others.
One of the room's two glasses was found in the sink, missing a piece; the other was on the shelf.
Detectives found some other items that might have been evidence: a hairpin, safety pin, unsmoked cigarette, and a full bottle of diluted sulfuric acid.
Four fingerprints, small enough that detectives believed they had been a woman's, were found on the room's phone; they could not be matched to Ogletree or to any of the hotel employees who had been known to have entered the room.
The police sought help through the press.
Both of the city's evening newspapers carried the story on their front pages the next day.
"There is no doubt that someone else is mixed up in this", Detective Johnson told reporters, confirming that the case was considered a homicide.
It soon became apparent that "Roland T. Owen" was in all likelihood an alias.
Officers in Kansas City contacted the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) to notify next of kin, but were informed that they could find no record that anyone under that name was living in the California city at the time.
The dead man's fingerprints were sent to what was at the time the Justice Department's Bureau of Investigation (later the FBI) to find a possible match in their collection.
A woman called the Hotel President that night to ask what "Roland T. Owen" looked like.
She told the desk that he lived in Clinton, southeast of Kansas City.
On January 6, the Sunday newspapers reported that the man in Room 1046 had died under an assumed name, and tips began coming in.
Members of the public went to the local funeral home where he had been laid out, leading Lane to tell police of his encounter with the man.
After interviewing Lane, Johnson was not as certain as Lane was that the man had been Ogletree, since none of the hotel staff had reported seeing him leave or return during the night of January 3–4.
Police were able to establish one sighting of Ogletree outside the hotel, a report that he had been seen with two women at several "liquor places" on 12th Street.
Wire services began picking up the story, and it ran in newspapers and on radio around the country, with requests to send photographs to Kansas City.
More leads on the man's identity came in as a result, and the KCPD had to devote considerable time to corresponding with police all over the country via mail and telegram to follow up on leads.
Eventually they were able to eliminate many.
In Kansas City, an early lead proved false when a bloodied towel found at the hotel turned out to have been used to clean up Room 1046 after the police had left.
Officers recalled Propst's account that on his way there after he checked in, the man had said that he had left the nearby Muehlebach Hotel after one night due to their high rates, and checked with that hotel's staff.
No Roland T. Owen had checked in there, but staff recalled a man of Ogletree's appearance checking in under the name Eugene K. Scott, also giving Los Angeles as his address, and requesting a room on the interior of the building.
Again, after investigating, the LAPD reported that there was no one by that name in their city.
The mystery seemed solved when a man identified the body as his cousin, but then when the man's sister came to view the body, she confirmed that the cousin had in fact died five years earlier; the resemblance between the two had been very strong.
A week into the investigation, Toni Bernardi, a wrestling promoter from Little Rock, Arkansas, said after viewing the body that the man, identifying himself as Cecil Werner, had approached him around the beginning of December 1934 about wrestling some matches.
Bernardi had referred him to another promoter in Omaha, Nebraska, but that promoter did not recognize Ogletree.
Within a few days, two new homicides in the city drew detectives' attention away from the case, even as more were assigned to the homicide squad.
Leads were still followed, but less vigorously than they had been in the week after the case, and none of them yielded any significant information.
Newspaper coverage likewise dwindled.
The case returned to the newspapers on March 3, when the funeral home where the body had been kept announced it would be burying the man in the city's potter's field the next day.
That day, the funeral home received a call from a man who asked that the funeral be delayed so they could send the funeral home the money for a grave and service at Memorial Park Cemetery in Kansas City, Kansas, so, the caller said, the dead man would be near his sister.
The funeral director warned the caller he would have to tell the police about the call; the caller said he knew and that did not bother him.
The caller was slightly more forthcoming when the funeral director asked why Ogletree had been killed.
According to the caller, Ogletree had had an affair with one woman while engaged to marry another.
The caller and the two women had apparently arranged the encounter with him at the President in order to exact revenge.
"Cheaters usually get what's coming to them!"
the caller said, and hung up.
The service was postponed per the anonymous caller's request.
On March 23, the funeral home received a delivery envelope, the address carefully lettered using a ruler with $25 ($ in current dollars) wrapped in newspaper; it was enough to cover the expenses.
The sender was unknown.
Two additional envelopes with $5 each were sent to a local florist for an arrangement of 13 American Beauty roses to go with the grave, after a similar call was made to them; both phone calls turned out to have been made from pay phones.
Included with this payment was a card, with disguised handwriting, reading "Love Forever – Louise".
The funeral was held shortly afterwards.
Besides the officiating minister, the only attendees were police detectives, some of whom served as pallbearers.
Other detectives, posing as gravediggers, staked out the grave for the next several days, but no one came to visit.
Several days after the funeral, a woman called the "Kansas City Journal-Post"s newsroom to inform them that their earlier story that the dead man from Room 1046 would be buried in a pauper's grave was incorrect, that he had in fact been given a formal funeral.
She said the funeral home and flower shop could verify this.
Asked to identify herself, she said "Never mind, I know what I'm talking about", Pressed for what that was, she responded, "He got into a jam", and ended the conversation.
Images of the dead man continued to be circulated nationwide in the hope of identifying him.
One of these finally did, when a friend of Ruby Ogletree in Birmingham, Alabama, showed her an issue of "The American Weekly", a Sunday newspaper supplement published by the Hearst Corporation, with an article about the case.
The unidentified man looked a great deal like her son Artemus, whom the family had not seen since he left to hitchhike to California in 1934, although he had kept up correspondence with them.
Ruby contacted the KCPD, and was able to provide enough information about the previous pseudonymous corpse, including a description of his head scar, which she explained was the result of a childhood accident in which some hot grease had spilled there.
In November, another issue of the supplement carried a story identifying the man as Artemus Ogletree and explaining how his identity had been determined.
While that question had been answered, Ruby's account raised more questions.
She had received several letters purportedly from her son "after" he had been killed.
The first, early in 1935, postmarked in Chicago, aroused her suspicions since it was typewritten, and Artemus as far as she knew did not know how to type.
It was also written in a highly colloquial style, with much slang, that was not consistent with his previous letters.
In May 1935, another letter purportedly from Artemus said he was going to Europe.
It was followed by a special-delivery letter saying that his ship was sailing that day.
Both missives were sent from New York.
Three months later, in August, Ruby received a telephone call from Memphis, Tennessee.
A man on the other end of the line told her that Artemus had saved his life in a fight.
Artemus himself could not call because he was now living in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, where he had married a wealthy woman and was well.
He was unable to write, the caller said, because he had lost one of his thumbs in the fight where he had saved the caller.
Ruby talked with the man for a half-hour.
She recalled that he had talked wildly and irrationally, but seemed to have firsthand knowledge of Artemus.
She gave the police the name the man identified himself by; it has never been made public.
If Artemus had, at some point before his death, gone to Egypt or anywhere else overseas, he had not done so under his own name.
No steamship company at the time had any record that he had traveled with them.
The consular section at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo was unable to find any evidence he had been there.
Information developed through the police's conversations with Ruby Ogletree helped them establish a third hotel in Kansas City, the St. Regis, where Artemus had stayed.
There, he had roomed with another man.
Whether that had been "Don" could not be established.
In 1937 the New York City police arrested a man named Joseph Martin on a murder charge, after he had killed a man he roomed with and put the body in a trunk to be shipped to Memphis.
Among the several aliases he was found to have used was "Donald Kelso".
According to a story about the case in "The New Yorker", the KCPD had matched samples of his handwriting to that in the letters written to Ruby Ogletree.
No charges were filed against the man for the Ogletree case, and the KCPD kept the case open.
The files show that different detectives reviewed the case every few years through the 1950s.
Each time they noted that they would keep the case open and follow up, but no new evidence was uncovered.
Gradually the case went cold.
In 2003 or 2004, John Horner, a local historian at the Kansas City Public Library, fielded a call from someone out of state who said they had been helping to inventory the belongings of an elderly person who had recently died.
Among them was a shoebox which turned out to be filled with newspaper clippings related to the case, as well as, according to them, one item mentioned in the newspaper stories.
The caller identified neither themselves nor the item.
Horner did not make this public until the conclusion of the second of two posts he made on the library's blog retelling the story in 2012.
The absence of suspects has not prevented theories about the case from arising.
The telephone calls alleging that Ogletree was killed in retaliation for his broken engagement have provided support for that theory.
Organized crime has also been considered, since the name "Don" can also be a title for a Mafia boss.
Lastly, it has been suggested that "Don", whoever he was, killed Ogletree for some personal reason, either with the help of the "commercial woman" Blocher saw in the hotel late that night or by himself.
2018 New Hampshire Senate election
The 2018 New Hampshire Senate election was held on November 6, 2018, concurrently with the elections for the New Hampshire House of Representatives, to elect members to the 166th New Hampshire General Court.
All 24 seats in the New Hampshire Senate were up for election.
It resulted in Democrats gaining control of both chambers of the New Hampshire General Court, ending the total control of New Hampshire's state government, that Republicans had held in New Hampshire since the 2016 state elections.
Primary elections were held on September 11, 2018.
In the 2016 New Hampshire state elections, Republicans held on to their majority of 14-10 in the New Hampshire Senate.
Republicans also maintained control of the New Hampshire House of Representatives.
In addition, Republican Chris Sununu won the open 2016 New Hampshire gubernatorial election giving the New Hampshire Republican Party total control for the first time since Governor Craig Benson was defeated by Democrat John Lynch in the 2004 New Hampshire gubernatorial election.
In the aftermath of his 2016 election, then president-elect Donald Trump claimed in a tweet that voter fraud had occurred in New Hampshire.
In February 2017, Trump advisor Stephen Miller reaffirmed that position by claiming "busing voters in to New Hampshire is widely known by anyone who’s worked in New Hampshire politics".
These claims were called "baseless" by several observers.
In response to those allegations, the Republican majorities in the New Hampshire General Court drafted bills changing voter registration rules.
Senate Bill 3 (SB 3) passed both chambers of the New Hampshire General Court on party-line votes and was signed in to law by Governor Sununu on July, 10 2017.
The new law requires voters to declare a "domicile" in New Hampshire.
It also included jail sentences of up to one year or a fine of up to $5,000, if voters registered and not provided necessary paperwork as proof within 10 day or 30 days in smaller towns.
Republicans pointed to over 5,000 voters who voted in the 2016 election after identifying with an out-of-state driver's licence, that have not gotten an in-state licence as of September 2017.
Democrats suspected a voter suppression scheme, that targeted college students, that they think are most likely to use identification issued by other states.
The League of Women Voters, the New Hampshire Democratic Party and several college students challenged the new law in court.
They pointed to the Supreme Court's decision in Symm v. United States, that guaranteed college students the right to vote at their university.
The trial judge of the Hillsborough Superior Court decided on October 22, 2018, that the state cannot apply the law in the upcoming elections.
The Attorney General of New Hampshire's office then filed an emergency motion with the New Hampshire Supreme Court.
The State Supreme Court sided with the state in an unanimous 5-0 decision arguing that overturning the law so close to elections was potentially confusing and disruptive.
The State Supreme Court did not decide on the merits of the law in this decision.
Therefore, SB3 was first applied in the 2018 elections.
In the 2018 elections, Democrats saw gains in state elections across the countries, gaining multiple Governorships and legislative chambers.
Democrats also won control of the United States House of Representatives for the first time since 2010.
Commentators called the election results a "blue wave", that was especially pronounced in state elections.
In the New Hampshire Senate, Democrats were able to flip Districts 9, 11, 12, 23 and 24, while the Republicans flipped District 1.
The Democratic gains were mostly in less rural areas in Southern and Eastern New Hampshire while the Republican gains were limited to one rural seat in the North Country.The incumbent Democratic Senator in District 1 one was accused of domestic violence and charged a few months before the election.
Incumbent Democratic State Senator Jeff Woodburn had represented the New Hampshire's 1st State Senate District since 2012.
Senator Woodburn had also served as Senate Minority Leader since 2014.
Woodburn was arrested on August 2, 2018 on simple assault, domestic violence, criminal mischief, and criminal trespass charges.
Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley called on him to resign.

George Nathanael Anderson
George Nathanael Anderson (August 8, 1883 – October 8, 1958) was an American Lutheran pastor and missionary to Tanganyika.
Anderson studied at Bethany College in Lindsborg, Kansas and the Augustana Theological Seminary before being ordained by the Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church in 1912.
He held a succession of posts in the American Mid West before volunteering for missionary service.
Anderson was sent to the British colony of Tanganyika in 1924 to review the situation there.
As a former German colony the territory had hosted missions of the German Lutheran Church but these were expelled in 1917 during the First World War.
Anderson reported favourably and a formal Augustana Church mission was sent in 1926, with Anderson at its head.
Anderson oversaw the expansion of the church's role in the territory and in 1944 was appointed President and director of its General Administrative Committee, becoming responsible for the church's entire operation in Tanganyika.
He retired in 1956 and died in the United States two years later.
George Nathanael Anderson was born on August 8, 1883 in Morganville, Kansas.
He graduated from Bethany College in Lindsborg, Kansas in 1909.
He later graduated from the Augustana Theological Seminary; studied at the University of Minnesota and the Union Theological Seminary and was awarded a doctorate.
Anderson was ordained as a pastor in 1912 and found work preaching in the Midwestern United States with the Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church.
At one point he was at the First Lutheran Church in Saint Paul, Minnesota where he ministered to a congregation of over 1,500 people.
In 1919 he was amongst a group of people praying at a church meeting for a new bible school to train Lutheran missionaries.
Amongst the attendees was Annette Elmquist, who had attended a non-Lutheran bible school and was keen for the church to have its own.
Soon afterwards Elmquist and Anderson were married.
The Lutheran church had been active in missionary work in Tanganyika before the First World War, however the largely German missionaries were expelled by British forces in 1917.
The Augustana Church was asked to take over the abandoned missions by the German Lutheran Church and in Summer 1924 Anderson with his wife and three sons (LeRoy.
Paul and Marcus) visited the colony.
Anderson reported good potential in the area and a formal mission was dispatched by the church in 1926, with Anderson being appointed a missionary by the church's Board of Foreign Missions.
After some deliberation (he would have to leave behind his family, including daughter Dorothy who was then ill with tuberculosis) Anderson agreed and returned to Tanganyika on January 6, 1926 with fellow missionaries Herbert S Magney and Ludwig Melander.
Anderson initially spent his time teaching new pastors at the mission's seminary in Marangu but reported to the church that there was a good appetite for the Lutheran faith in Iramba and it was decided to establish a mission there.
Anderson was appointed head of the mission and led four American missionaries and one from Leipzig (who held Russian citizenship and so was permitted entry by the British authorities).
Anderson's speciality was in evangelism and the study of the Iramba language, into which he translated the New Testament and various hymns, liturgies and catechisms .
Anderson's wife and children joined him at Iramba from 1927 and remained with him until his retirement in 1956, though Annette would sometimes reside in the United States with some of the children to ensure their education.
One son, Marcus, died in Iramba of Malaria.
They had seven surviving children of which four sons became pastors, including one who was a missionary in Tanganyika.
One of Anderson's daughters married a missionary and served for her entire life at a mission in Iramba.
Anderson occasionally returned to the United States on leave and during these periods worked to generate support for the African missions.
During one such visit he helped to found the Lutheran Bible Institute.
From 1944 he was appointed president and director of the General Administrative Committee of the Augustana Lutheran Church (which until 1944 was known as the General Committee of Former German Missions).
In this role, which he held until 1952, he was responsible for liaising with the Tanganyikan government.
One key task was to negotiate with the colony's government over the ownership of land and property formerly held by the German Lutheran Church.
During Anderson's time in Africa the Lutheran missions expanded to encompass a number of churches and dispensaries, a hospital at Kiomboi and leper centres at Mkalama and Iambi.
He described the effect of listening to a congregation of 2,000 singing Luther's hymn "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God": "I never heard it sung with more spirit; the effect was almost overwhelming".
Anderson retired in 1956 and was invited to remain in Tanganyika by the local church but chose to return to the United States.
He died on October 8, 1958 in Minneapolis.
The Bromley Boys
The Bromley Boys is a 2018 British, coming-of-age, warm-hearted, humorous film.
Based on an eponymous autographical book by author Dave Roberts, the film is set in north Kent, in the suburbs of London, during the late 1960s and early 1970s.
The story is about the teenaged David "Dave" Roberts, who becomes a fan of his local football club, Bromley F.C., a club who at the time were, "the worst football team in Britain".
The film touches briefly on the euphoria caused by England winning the World Cup in 1966, but mainly recounts the events in the protagonist's life during the 1969/1970 season of the Bromley team.
In the late 1960s, a young British teenager, David (Dave) Roberts (Brenock O'Connor), is living in his parents' house in Sevenoaks.
He wishes to follow a major football (soccer) team, but because of his father's strong disapproval, he is forced into secretly following his local club, Bromley FC, who at that time were losing almost every game they played.
Nonetheless, David instantly becomes a devoted fan.
He attends, and carefully analyses every match, and keeps a scrapbook of every press mention they get, no matter how negative.
His favorite player is the team's star, center forward Alan "Stoney" Stonefield (Ross Anderson).
David meets and become close friends with three adult Bromley FC fans (TJ Herbert, Mark Dymond, Ewen MacIntosh) who encourage and support him.
Dave also meets, and rapidly falls in love with, Ruby McQueen (Savannah Baker), the pretty and bright teenage daughter of Charlie McQueen (Jamie Foreman), the tough scary Chairman of the football club.
Having sneaked into Charlie McQueen's office, and noticed some notes on player's files, Dave believes that McQueen has received large cash offers from both Manchester United and Leeds United to sell Stoney away from Bromley.
It seems to Dave that McQueen is planning to accept, in order to pay off his massive gambling debts, which have rendered the club bankrupt.
Dave happens to accidentally meet Stoney, who turns out to be very kind, and strikes up a friendship with him.
The news of the supposed offer to buy Stoney is leaked to the press.
The Chairman see this news on television, and now imagines he will be able to pay off all his gambling debts and come out ahead.
He announces the good news about Stoney at a party, and explains he can now afford to send his daughter to university to become a doctor, her dream.
But Dave suddenly understands that he misinterpreted what he read: the notes he saw were not about cash offers from leading football clubs, instead they were offers to Ruby from Manchester University and Leeds University.
There will be no money coming in.
In order to save Bromley, Dave browbeats the Chairman into selling his expensive sports car, and betting all of the cash on Bromley FC to win their final game of the season, at odds of 10 to 1 against.
Dave also demands that the Chairman allow him to manage the team for this one final game.
Despite Dave's attempts to suggest a new game plan, the first half of the game goes poorly, with Bromley scoring an own goal.
But then Dave accidentally finds out that his father was originally a brilliant athlete who played youth soccer for England before being crippled in an accident on the field.
Before the Bromley team goes out for the second half, Dave gives an impassioned speech, which Stoney endorses, and which causes the team to play better than anyone would have thought possible.
First a tie goal is scored, and then Stoney manages to score a very challenging goal on a free kick, and Bromley FC wins 2-1.
Dave is carried off the field in triumph, and joy all round.

Voces Unidas
Voces Unidas is a studio album recorded by several famous latin artists for the Olympic Games "Atlanta 1996", released on May 14, 1996 through EMI Latin.
The album was a success, reaching the fifth place in the "Billboard" Latin 50 chart.
In early 1996, Emilio Estefan and EMI Latin president José Behar planned to bring together the most important Spanish-speaking artists and create material for the upcoming Olympic Games, as a reaction to several English-speaking artists that were preparing their albums for the Olympic Games.
Estefan and Behar had a conversation about the project with Atlanta Olympic Games committee, among them marketing vice-president Lous Wayne Cunningham.
Behar said "Hispanics, in Latin America and Spain, have different cultures and customs, but there is something spiritual that unites us, and that is the language".
After the Olympic Games committee agreed, Estefan started the recording of the album, although they didn't do it in the same studio, each artist recorded his or her song separately.
Among the producers are included Marc Anthony, Emilio Estefan, Christian Walden and Oscar Mediavilla.
Also some of the locations of recording include Miami, New York City, Los Angeles and Rio de Janeiro.
Moreover, Emilio was chosen to produce "Reach", the official theme song of 1996 Summer Olympic Games, and it gained a huge exposure thanks to Gloria Estefan's performance of the song at the Olympics closing ceremony.
Emilio produced "Puedes Llegar", a Spanish version of Gloria Estefan's "Reach", which was recorded by several artists: Gloria Estefan, Jon Secada, Julio Iglesias, Placido Domingo, Roberto Carlos, Jose Luis Rodríguez, Patricia Sosa, Alejandro Fernández, Ricky Martin and Carlos Vives.
"Puedes Llegar" was released as a promotional single and reached the position 2 on "Billboard" Hot Latin Tracks chart in June 1996.

Rengat massacre
The Rengat massacre (, ) was committed by the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army on 5 January 1949 in Rengat, Riau during Operation "Kraai".
Following the capture of the town, paratroopers of the "Korps Speciale Troepen" under lieutenant Rudy de Mey subjected confirmed and suspected TNI militants, civil servants, and ordinary townspeople to looting, rape, and summary execution.
Bodies were disposed of in the Indragiri River.
Estimates of the death toll of the Rengat massacre have varied significantly between sources.
The Resident of Riau claimed that 400 people had been shot.
In turn, the Riau district prosecutor put the death toll at 120 total dead, further reducing the number of victims to "around 80" in his conclusion.
This amount has consistently appeared in Dutch official statements since at least 1969.
Indonesian sources, including a memorial site on location, estimate a death toll of between 1500 and 2000.
Other sources have claimed up to 2600 wounded and dead, including the father of famed author Chairil Anwar.

Pratap Manikya II
Pratap Manikya II (d. 1487) was a Maharaja of Tripura during the late 15th century.
Though Pratap Manikya is stated in the "Rajmala" to be a son of Dharma Manikya I, later scholarship proved this to be chronologically improbable.
It is instead believed that he was Dharma's grandson, with his father being Ratna Manikya I.
There were also uncertainties regarding the years of Pratap's rule.
A coin supposedly minted during his reign bears the year Saka 1412 (1490 CE), though the modern-style script has led to doubts regarding its authenticity.
It is notable that Pratap's immediate successors struck coins in 1488 and 1489 respectively.
A younger son of his father, Pratap's rule had been propped up by the support of prominent army generals in opposition to his elder brother Dhanya, against whom he waged a civil war.
According to the "Rajmala", because of his impiety, Pratap soon lost the support of these nobles, who launched a conspiracy against him.
The chronicle continues that due to his formidable physical strength and stoutness, Pratap had to be killed at night while he slept.
He was succeeded in quick succession by the minor Vijaya Manikya (who may have been his son) and Pratap's younger brother Mukut, before the throne finally settled on Dhanya, whose long reign lasted until 1515.

Guinea Pig: Devil's Experiment
The film is presented under the guise of being a video sent to director Satoru Ogura, with the explanation that it depicts "an experiment on the breaking point of bearable pain and the corrosion of people's senses".
In the film, three men abduct a woman and torture her before eventually killing her.
Their methods of torture include hitting and kicking her, pinching her with pliers, forcing her to endure sound torture, burning her with scalding oil, dumping maggots on her, and poking a needle through one of her eyes.
Writing about the presentation of "Devil's Experiment" as being a genuine snuff film, J. Doyle Wallis of DVD Talk wrote that "it didn't strike me as the slightest bit true", but noted that, "despite spotting the stumbles that betray its reality, it is quite disturbing".
He called it "hard to watch" and "bold but also utterly deplorable", and asserted that its "perversity is there merely to exploit a part of the human psyche that is totally without merit."
In his book "Eros in Hell: Sex, Blood and Madness in Japanese Cinema", Jack Hunter wrote that the filming and editing techniques implemented in the film lend to it being "an effective and surprisingly low-key meditation on the cumulative dehumanization that violence causes in both aggressor and victim alike."
In "Nightmare Japan: Contemporary Japanese Horror Cinema", author Jay McRoy similarly notes such techniques, writing that while the film "[blurs] audience distinctions between fact and fiction, thus heightening the visceral impact generated by the 'experiment's' verisimilitude", its "technical sophistication and artistry" exposes its fictional nature.

New Synagogue (Darmstadt)
The Neue Synagoge ("New Synagogue") is the synagogue, community centre, and museum of the Jewish community () in Darmstadt.
Constructed in 1988 for the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the complex was designed to fulfil the needs of the city's Jewish population, who had been without a place of worship since the 1938 pogrom when Darmstadt's three synagogues were destroyed.
Built according to plans by Alfred Jacoby, with stained glass and a Torah ark by British architectural artist Brian Clarke, the complex, also known as the Holocaust Memorial Synagogue, is located on the site of the city's former Gestapo headquarters.
The first "newly constructed synagogue in the postwar period to recall the traditional form of a central, domed building", the design marked the start of Jacoby's development of a distinct modern Jewish religious architectural vernacular.

Wendell H. Gauthier
Wendell H. Gauthier (; April 14, 1943 – December 12, 2001) was an attorney known for a variety of major class action lawsuits.
He is best known for his leading role in Castano v. American Tobacco Company which established that large tobacco companies could be liable for injury to its users.
The dramatic case was fictionalized into John Grisham's bestselling novel Runaway Jury and directly led to numerous other "Son of Costano" suits and the $246 billion Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, the largest settlement in history.
Wendell Gauthier was raised in Iota, Louisiana, a small town in the Acadiana region of Louisiana.
His father was a construction foreman as well as a city councilman and his mother was a school teacher.
His father managed Edwin Edward's first political campaign when Wendell was 11 and the two developed a close relationship.
Gauthier graduated from Iota High School before earning an undergraduate degree from the University of Southwest Louisiana (Now University of Louisiana at Lafayette) where he met his future wife, Anne Barrios.
He moved to New Orleans and taught high school, as well as driver's education across the metropolitan area while simultaneously earning his Juris Doctorate from the Loyola University New Orleans College of Law.
He was the first member of his family to attend college.
There he became best friends with Peter Castano whose death would trigger the start of the third wave of Tobacco litigation.
Gauthier used his unsophisticated background to full effect in the courtroom, connecting with jurors through a "infectious, perpetual, coprophagous grin", "soft cajun accent", and numerous "country-lawyer malapropisms".Further, he complimented his casual style with pranks and showmanship influenced by Melvin Belli.
Gauthier was also a coalition builder in a field that was normally extremely competitive and looked beyond his field to form close partnerships with politicians including dozens of city mayors including Mayor Marc Morial as well as Governor Edwin Edwards, and President Clinton.
Wendell Gauthier's first notable cases were a series of seven gas explosions at homes in the metro area.
Gauthier agreed to be part of a panel of experts that fixed the problem, preventing more explosions and therefore more lawsuits.
Gauthier said that it "put me out of the gas pipe business, but I was glad to be a part of the panel".
The MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas caught fire November 21st, 1980 with approximately 3,400 registered guests inside.
Eighty-four people died and more than a thousand more suffered injury.
Gauthier, along with a team of eight other named attorneys and their firms successfully reached a $170 million dollar settlement.
Wendell Gauthier died in his home of Liver cancer Wednesday, December 12th, 2001.
Wendell Gauthier's daughter, Celeste Gauthier now continues the Gauthier name in the firm that Wendell founded in the 1970s and which still operates out of the same building.
They undertake a variety of suits but have expanded, under the direction of managing partner John Houghtaling, to represent property owners against insurance companies.
During his life, Wendell Gauthier served as a visiting member of his alma matar's faculty and after his death, Anne Gauthier donated a new 17,657 square foot wing to the law school.
This was the largest gift the college ever received from an individual.
The "family and friends of Mr. Gauthier" also established the Wendell H. Gauthier Lectureship in Trial Advocacy and Practice at Tulane University's Law School.
The Wendell and Anne Gauthier Family Foundation supports "music, visual arts, and Catholic education".
The foundation funds the Peter J. Castano Endowed Scholarship and the Michael St. Martin Chair in Environmental Law at Loyola New Orleans.
The foundation also supports the Musical Arts Society of New Orleans, the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra , and the George Rodrigue Foundation.
The family foundation purchased the "Saga of the Acadians" in order to allow it to tour throughout the Acadiana and the rest of the state.
Wendell Gauthier is portrayed as Wendell Rohr in John Grisham's bestselling 1996 novel Runaway Jury as well as the movie adaptation.
The novel uses the Castano v. American Tobacco Company case as its setting while the movie, released in 2003 substitutes gun control as the issue being litigated.
Celeste Wood, another major character, may be named for Wendell's daughter Celeste.

State and official visits to the United Kingdom
State and official visits to the United Kingdom are formal visits by the head of state of one country to the United Kingdom, during which the British Sovereign acts as official host of the visitor.
It is a royal event that involves the all assets in the Civil Service, the Royal Household and the Household Division.
It also involves other members of the Royal family and is centered in London, the national capital.
Invitations for state visits are sent by the Royal Household with supervision by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
State visits do not formally occur between the United Kingdom and the 15 other Commonwealth realms, as the realms all share a common monarch and head of state.
Visits conducted by the monarch to another Commonwealth realm are also not considered a state visits but rather royal visits.
In addition, official visits to the United Kingdom by another Commonwealth realm are typically performed by their respective governor general, who in that capacity are usually in the country for an audience with the Queen.
One of the more notable as well as earliest instances of a state visit to the British Isle is the Grand Embassy of Peter the Great, which was a diplomatic mission to Western Europe in 1697 and 1698 led by Peter the Great of the Russian Empire.
The modern pomp and ceremonial came about in the early 19th century.
Examples of this new protocol in action included the Allied sovereigns' visit to England in June 1814.
Queen Victoria hosted Napoleon III for a state visit at Windsor Castle in 1855, although it consisted of more informal arrangements.
Very few formal state visits to the country did not take place prior to the reign of Queen Elizabeth in the 20th century.
One of those few state visits included one by Kaiser Wilhelm II during the reign of his uncle Edward VII in 1907.
Most dignitaries arrive at London Heathrow Airport, although there are cases of visitors arriving at London Stansted Airport instead.
They are usually greeted on behalf of the Queen by a member of the Royal family and the UK Foreign Secretary.
The dignitary and the monarch then ride down The Mall in a state carriage (usually the 1902 State Landau) escorted by the Household Cavalry with street liners coming from the Foot Guards.
Union Flags and the flags of the visiting country are usually draped on both sides of the road.
An arrival ceremony usually takes place on Horse Guards Parade (although there are also some instances where it takes place at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle) with a Guard of Honour being provided by members of the Queen's Guard (usually found from one of the five regiments of foot guards: Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards, Scots Guards, Irish Guards, and the Welsh Guards).
Prior to a welcoming ceremony at Windsor Castle, the state guest receives a welcome at Datchet railway station with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment and it's mounted band.
Following the performance of the national anthems, first of the visiting country and then "God Save the Queen" (although the former is the sole piece that played most of the time), the commander of the guard of honour formation, usually a junior officer, will always report to the dignitary in the language of the visitor, with the report being along the lines of the following:
After the report, the selected band plays a slow march while the formation of company size is inspected.
Depending on the area where the ceremony takes place, a march past will immediately take place following the inspection.
If it takes place on Horse Guards Parade, then the foreign guest and the Queen travel to Buckingham Palace in a carriage procession escorted by a large number of mounted soldiers from the Household Cavalry.
The welcome ceremony is accompanied by 21-gun salutes fired from Green Park and the Tower of London.
Exceptions to this included Xi Jinping who was received with a 41-gun salute in Green Park and a simultaneous 62-gun salute at the Tower of London and City of London (103 guns in total).
In recent years, Windsor Castle has hosted arrival ceremonies from President Thank Mbeki of South Africa, Abdullah II of Jordan, President Barack Obama and Margrethe II of Denmark.
During the lattermost visit, the guard of honour was provided by the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, a unit of which she is Colonel in Chief.
Guards of honour have also been accorded for visiting dignitaries who are in the country on official or even working visits, including Soviet leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Mikhail Gorbachev in 1956 and 1989 respectively as well as US President Donald Trump in 2018.
Upon returning home from the latter visit, Trump falsely claimed that the Queen, who accompanied him during his inpsection of the 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards at Windsor Castle, "reviewed her Honor Guard for the first time in 70 years", despite the fact that at the time she had only been sovereign for 65 years.
The largest guard of honour to be formed up for a state visit was in 2003 during the visit of President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush, when an arrival ceremony took place in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace, in which the Household Cavalry and the King's Troop were paraded in front of the visiting dignitaries.
Dignitaries have an informal lunch with the Queen before viewing the Royal Collection's artefacts and exchanging gifts with the Royals.
After all royal mertings are held, the visitor then engages in meetings with leaders in Her Majesty's Government, beginning with the British Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street.
In many of these meetings, multi-million pound business agreements are settled upon.
Meetings are also held with the Leader of the Opposition, the leaders of all parties in the House of Commons, and members of the British Cabinet.
In June 1978, Nicolae Ceaușescu made a state visit to the UK where a £200m licensing agreement was signed between the Romanian government and British Aerospace for the production of more than eighty BAC One-Eleven aircraft, which was said to be at the time the biggest civil aircraft agreement between two countries.
The visiting head of state, upon the Queen's request, may also be given the chance to give an address to both chambers of the British Parliament assembled on the halls of the House of Lords.
He/she addresses members of both chambers on the importances of political, economic and cultural ties shared by his/her home country with the millions of people of the United Kingdom.
The joint speech is presided by the Speaker of the House of Commons in coordination with the Lord Speaker.
The first foreign dignitary undertake such a reception was French President Albert Lebrun in March 1939 and most recently was under taken by Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands.
Heads of state from over 70 countries have laid wreaths at The Unknown Warrior during state visits.
State dinners are held at Buckingham Palace in London and on occasion at Windsor Castle in Berkshire, should the visitors stay there.
Around 150 guests are invited to the white tie event at the ballroom in Buckingham Palace for the banquet, which is an area that has a max capacity of 170 diners.
Guests typically members of the Royal Family, members of the visiting delegation, British politicians and notable figures from both countries.
Preparations of the state dinner are the responsibility of the Master of the Household and begin months in advance.
The seating chart for the event is confirmed both by the Queen and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
During the dinner, honours and decorations of both heads of state are worn and both speeches are checked extensively by the Foreign office.
The preparation of food begins closer to the start of the dinner to ensure the food is still fresh by the time it reahces the table.
This also means that every dish is prepared by hand from scratch.
The meal spans over four courses that include: fish; main course, pudding and dessert.
Each place setting has six glasses (for water, red and white wine, dessert wine, champagne and port) and up to a dozen pieces of cutlery.
The menu is chosen by the Queen from a choice of four presented by the royal kitchen.
Alcoholic drinks come from the Government Wine Cellar, while the food is prepared by chefs of the Royal Household.
Large silver-gilt dishes and vessels (both of which are never used durung the ceremony) are arranged in tiers on the central table.
Scotland is the most frequently visited constituent country in the UK during state visits.
They are usually hosted by the either the Queen or the First Minister of Scotland on this visit.
When hosted by the Queen, the visitor stays at either Edinburgh Castle or Holyrood Palace.
When hosted by the devolved executive government in Scotland, the visitor holds bilateral meetings at St Andrew's House.
During the visit, a speech to the Scottish Parliament is given in the chamber, being broadcast on Parliament TV with the Presiding Officer of the Parliament being the host.
Previous visits to the parliament have included:
The reigning monarch will usually host one or two states visits per year.
The reigning monarch has hosted 152 state visits since becoming the head of state in 1952.
Many controversies have arose from state visits to the United Kingdom, particularly in relation to the human rights record of the visitor:

Ursus Major Mountain
Ursus Major Mountain is a mountain summit located in Glacier National Park, in the Hermit Range of the Selkirk Mountains in British Columbia, Canada.
Ursus Major Mountain is situated west of Rogers Pass, northeast of Revelstoke, and west of Golden.
Its nearest higher peaks are Catamount Peak, to the southwest, and Ursus Minor Mountain, to the northeast.
The first ascent of the mountain was made August 5, 1902, by a Dominion Topographic Survey party.
The mountain's name was adopted in 1906, then re-approved September 8, 1932, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada.
It was so-named by the survey party because of its proximity above Bear Creek (since renamed Connaught Creek), and in keeping with the bear theme of other nearby features such as Ursus Minor Mountain, Grizzly Mountain, Bruins Pass, and Balu Pass.
The high point on Ursus Major's east ridge is unofficially called "Balu Peak".
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Ursus Major Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.
Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.
Precipitation runoff from the mountain and meltwater from small unnamed glaciers on its slopes drains into tributaries of the Illecillewaet River and Beaver River.
John Goodrich (Loyalist)
John Goodrich (1722–1785) was a Virginia-born British planter, merchant shipper, and privateer.
Uncommitted at the beginning of the American Revolution, he was recruited by Lord Dunmore to become a Loyalist privateer.
By his own estimation, he destroyed five hundred vessels in the service of the British Crown.
Goodrich was born in Virginia in 1722, one of several children of John Goodrich (d. 1746).
Unlike many Loyalists, Goodrich had deep roots in colonial America; his immigrant ancestor, "John Guttreidge", had patented land in Virginia in 1654.
In 1747 he married the descendant of another prominent local family, Margaret Bridger, a descendant of the 17th-century Virginia political figure General Joseph Bridger.
They raised a large family, including a number of sons that would follow their father into mercantile pursuits and, later, privateering.
One of his daughters, Agatha, married Robert Shedden, who would also become a prominent Loyalist as well as Goodrich's business partner.
Some of his close relatives ended up on the opposite side of the conflict, including two nephews who served as officers on the Patriot side.
A keen businessman, Goodrich spent his early adult years expanding his landholdings.
Over the course of several years, he purchased hundreds of acres of land in Nansemond and Isle of Wight counties.
By 1771 he owned over 2,000 acres of land, some of it described as the best land in the county.
Starting in the 1760s, he began to turn his interest from farming to shipping.
He and his sons owned and operated a dozen ships by 1774, and Goodrich also owned his own wharves, dry goods stores, warehouses, and other establishments useful to his shipping business.
Operating primarily out of Portsmouth, his small fleet shipped agricultural and timber commodities to the West Indies and to other ports in the colonies.
The Revolutionary War posed a serious threat to merchants like Goodrich, with blockades cutting off imports and exports, and privateers from both sides attacking merchant vessels.
Goodrich himself does not seem to have been particularly ideological; both sides of the conflict apparently understood he was more motivated by profit than politics.
Regardless, the Patriot side decided to enlist the aid of the Goodrich family.
Using one of Goodrich's sons, William, as a go-between, they provided £5,000 for the purchase of powder in the West Indies, with the understanding that John Goodrich, the father, would assist him in successfully bringing the cargo back without attracting notice.
The family elected to also purchase other cargo on the trip, risking the wrath of both the British and Patriot sides.
This mission proved to be a debacle for the Goodriches.
Though the powder did reach its destination, an intercepted letter to John Goodrich from his son-in-law Robert Shedden revealed the conspiracy to Dunmore, who took Shedden and another of Goodrich's sons into custody.
With John Goodrich, Jr., held as hostage, the elder John Goodrich sought an audience with Dunmore, where he expressed "sincere repentance of what was past and his earnest desire of returning to his duty".
Though he recognized Goodrich's essentially mercenary character, Dunmore seized the opportunity to augment British forces with a family of experienced, capable, and ambitious ship captains.
Having been convinced that his family's interests would be better served by the British, Goodrich and his family turned to the Loyalist cause.
The start of Goodrich's career as a Loyalist was not auspicious.
He set out to the West Indies to reclaim some of the money that had been left with a merchant there to purchase additional powder, but was quickly captured by British forces unaware of his new loyalties and promptly sent back to Dunmore.
The Patriots were, likewise, initially confused regarding his loyalties.
He was actually imprisoned by the Commonwealth of Virginia, which suspected him "of being unfriendly to the Colony", but when witnesses failed to appear he was released on a bond of £1,000 and the condition that he not be of assistance to America's enemies.
Goodrich and two of his sons were almost immediately charged again, this time with violating the Articles of Association.
On 9 March 1776, the Virginia Committee of Safety sequestered the lands and property of the Goodrich family, and when one of the Goodrich sons was caught attempting to transport slaves and stock from the sequestered property, the committee had the property confiscated and put up for auction.
This marked a decisive break with the Patriot side; General Charles Lee ordered Goodrich's house, as well as two of his ships, burned, justifying it on the grounds that Goodrich was one "of the most notorious Traitors", and that it would be a warning to others not to work with Dunmore.
Under his agreement with Dunmore, Goodrich's ships had been commissioned directly into government service, and he and his sons became some of the most notorious of the Loyalist privateers.
He was captured in North Carolina on 17 April 1776 while engaged in privateering, and by May was in a Virginia jail.
Being found guilty of treason, his entire estate was confiscated and he was imprisoned under guard, effectively a prisoner of war.
His sons vehemently rejected the committee's offer of neutrality and continued in royal service, with one joining Simcoe's Rangers, and John Goodrich himself returned to privateering after escaping prison.
Later in the war, Goodrich's privateering operation moved to New York, and grew over the course of the war to four fighting vessels; the largest, "The Dunmore", was a sixteen-gun ship.
After the war, Goodrich and several of his family members left the United States and settled in England.
He died in November of 1785, aged 63 years, and was interred at Topsham Church in Devon.
Edmund Randolph, in his "History of Virginia", remarked regarding Goodrich and his sons that "Virginia never repaired the loss which she sustained in these men."
In England, the descendants of John Goodrich were known as the Goodriches of Energlyn.
His son John Goodrich, Jr. was High Sheriff of Glamorganshire in 1798, while another descendant, James Pitt Goodrich, was High Sheriff of Denbighshire in 1878.
His Shedden descendants prospered as well; they lived for several generations at their estate at Spring Hill, East Cowes.

Roudaki Hall, including the piece "Shadow" for the flute and piano, performed at the Contemporary Composers Festival in Tehran; the string quartet "Suddenly", performed by the Iranian group "Chahargan"; the string quartet "Migration", performed by the group "Respina Quartet"; and the piece "Butterfly’s Dance", performed at the Contemporary Composers’ Piano Night.
In addition to composition, Zomorodi is skilled at improvisation, and at the Fereshteh Music Nights Festival one night was allotted to her improvisational playing.
"Specialized Meetings at Gozar Music Academy" were initiated by her in September 2010, aimed at keeping players, composers, masters, and researchers in touch, as well as upgrading the skills of Iranian students of art.
Zomorodi has been both financially and spiritually the main supporter of these meetings, which are held monthly at Tehran Book Cities and Gozar Music Academy.
Zomorodi taught music subjects to graduate and postgraduate students at Tehran University of Art and Islamic Azad University for some years.
When Gozar Music Academy was founded in 2015, she took up its management.
SS Connecticut (1938)
SS "Connecticut" was a 8684 ton tanker ship built in 1938 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation and used for a World War II.
She operated her under the United States Merchant Marine act for the War Shipping Administration, with United States Navy Armed Guards to man her deck guns.
On December 28, 1941 the "Connecticut" was torpedoed near Cape Disappointment in the Pacific Ocean by of the .
To stop from sinking the "Connecticut" ran aground and was later salvaged.

John Collins (Surveyor General)
John Collins was an influential Deputy Surveyor General in the Province of Canada shortly after it was captured by the British.
According to the Dictionary of Canadian Biography little is known of Collins's early life.
Samuel Johannes Holland, Surveyor General when Collins was appointed his deputy, on September 8, 1764, wrote that he had been "“imployed for many years as a deputy Surveyor in the Southern Colonys”".
The Dictionary of Canadian Biography notes he was a prominent Freemason.
His wife, Margaret, died in 1770, and he had at least one child, a daughter, Mary, who married John Rankin, also a surveyor.
Collins was appointed Deputy Surveyor General on September 8, 1764.
His first major assignment, in 1765 was to survey the border between Canada and the Province of New York.
On September 23, 1787, Collins represented Governor General Lord Dorchester in the negotiation of the Toronto Purchase.

Donald E. Stokes
Donald E. Stokes (1 April 1927 – 26 January 1997) was an American political scientist and dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.
Stokes was a founder of public opinion research, and a coauthor of the seminal book "The American Voter".
Stokes was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on April 1, 1957.
He obtained a bachelor's degree from Princeton University in 1951, and a PhD from Yale University in 1958.
Stokes began to work at the University of Michigan in 1958.
There he collaborated with fellow University of Michigan social scientists Angus Campbell, Philip Converse, and Warren Miller to write "The American Voter", which was one of the first major empirical studies of voting behavior.
Through thousands of interviews with American citizens during the election periods in 1948, 1952, 1954, 1956 and 1958, the authors first identified several of the core results in voting behavior that would form the Michigan model.
These include the importance of party identification, the low information level of many voters, and the large number of voters who remain undecided until immediately before an election.
In 1966, Campbell, Converse, Miller, and Stokes followed "The American Voter" with another book, "Elections and the Political Order".
Stokes studied the politics of the United Kingdom as well as American politics; he and David Butler conducted the first British Election Study, and coauthored the 1969 book "Political Change in Britain".
In 1971, Stokes became the dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies at the University of Michigan.
He held that position until 1974, when he moved to Princeton University.
At Princeton, he became the dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, which expanded significantly under his oversight.
Towards the end of his career, Stokes published the book "Pasteur's Quadrant", which studied the connection between basic science, applied science, and government policies.
Stokes is one of the most cited political scientists of all time, and is widely regarded as a founding scholar in the empirical study of political behavior.
Harold Tafler Shapiro, who was president of the University of Michigan and then of Princeton University, called Stokes "a pioneer in the development of modern political science".
International Criminal Court investigation in Palestine
On 20 December 2019, International Criminal Court chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda announced an investigation into alleged war crimes committed during the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
A preliminary investigation had been ongoing since 2015.
Israel is not a member of ICC, but the State of Palestine was allowed to join in 2015.
Israel has argued that the court does not apply to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict because Palestine is not a state, as Israeli attorney general Avichai Mandelblit argued in a brief released hours before Bensouda's announcement.
On three previous occasions, Bensouda has refused to open investigations against Israel related to the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid.
According to Bensouda, the criteria for a full investigation had all been met, but jurisdiction had not been established.
Bensouda stated, "I am satisfied that war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip".
According to Bensouda's report, the Israeli judicial system already makes provision for punishing those accused of war crimes—meaning that the ICC may not have jurisdiction over alleged Israeli violations.
Bensouda also found "a reasonable basis to believe that members of Hamas and Palestinian armed groups" are guilty of war crimes, but these groups have no mechanism for punishing such violations.
Israel is accused of illegally establishing West Bank settlements and violating the laws of war during the 2014 Gaza War, including claims of targeting Red Cross installations.
Armed Palestinian organizations, including Hamas, are accused of deliberately attacking Israeli civilians and using Palestinians as human shields.
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the investigation as "a black day for truth and justice" and "pure antisemitism", while Israeli newspaper "Yedioth Ahronoth" denounced "The Hague's hypocrisy" in a headline.
In an interview with "Times of Israel" Bensouda described the charge of antisemitism as "a particularly regrettable accusation that is without merit" and emphasized that the court strives to be fair and impartial.
United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated, "We firmly oppose this and any other action that seeks to target Israel unfairly."
Australia argued that the issues should be resolved by negotiation, while Germany stated that it trusts the court and wants to avoid politicising the case.
Hungary announced that it agrees with Israel's arguments about jurisdiction.
The Palestinian Authority issued a statement declaring that "Palestine welcomes this step as a long overdue step to move the process forward towards an investigation, after nearly five long and difficult years of preliminary examination".

Pinhas Alpert
Pinhas Alpert (ה׳ תשרי ה׳תש״י) is a professor of Atmospheric Sciences at Tel Aviv University.
Alpert was born in Jerusalem, on 1949.
On his father‘s side he is the 4th generation in Jerusalem - his great-grandfather came to Israel from Slonim-Russia in 1867, and was a teacher (Melamed, in Hebrew) in the Hurva Synagogue in the Old city.
Alpert studied until the age of 6 in his grandfather's "Cheder", then in the "Etz-Haim" Talmud-Torah in the Zichron-Moshe neighborhood of Jerusalem.
Then, he moved in 1957 to the  ”Moriah" school in the Bucharim neighborhood in Jerusalem.
His high school was ”Dugma.
After finishing high school he was accepted to the academic reserve (in Hebrew העתודה האקדמית) and studied Physics-Mathematics at the Hebrew University, in a special program which included computer studies for the first time in Israel.
Following his B.Sc., he continued to M.Sc.
in Physics during his IDF service.
In the IDF he became in 1973 a weather forecaster in the Air Force meteorology unit.
He later became the commander of meteorology for the Air Force‘s transport base, for 3 years.
In 1977 he left the IDF with the rank of captain, and later became a major during his reserve service.
Alpert was asked to continue his reserve service in the IDF, as an exception, until the age of 56, since he had developed the modeling scientific basis for the modern forecasting infrastructure at the Meteorological Service and the Air Force.
Alpert is married to Rachel, RN, and is the father of eight children.
During his service as a Meteorology officer in the Israel Air Force, Alpert was confronted with the severe difficulty of flood forecasting.
This motivated him to develop new techniques to predict and monitor rain, as well as to develop high-resolution models to improve forecasting.
In parallel with his military service, he began to work at the Hebrew University on light scattering from atmospheric aerosols.
After his release from the IDF he began his Ph.D. studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , during which he built his own meteorological model, which successfully explained the typical summer afternoon storms over the Sea of Galilee (Lake Kinneret).
Upon finishing his Ph.D. in 1980, he was invited to a post-doctorate at Harvard University.
For two years Alpert worked with Richard Lindzenand studied the Indian Monsoon.
During his post-doctorate he developed a physical model incorporating feedback from the moist surface.
After two years in Boston, in 1982, he was invited by the Department of Geophysics and Planetary Sciences at Tel-Aviv University (now the Department of Earth Sciences) to become a faculty member.
In the year 2004 he was elected an honorary member of the world Jewish Academy for Sciences.
During the years 2005-2008 Alpert served as Head of the Department of Geophysics at Tel-Aviv University, and then in 2008-2013 he served as the Head of the TAU Porter School for Environmental Studies.
Alpert‘s research group is engaged in theoretical studies and observations of the dynamics of atmospheric processes, using hydro-dynamical models for numerically solving the development of different phenomena.
He was the first to investigate theoretically several synoptic systems in Israel, including Sharav low, Cyprus low, Red Sea Trough, etc.
Remote sensing observations include satellites, radar, and recently data collected by cellular antennas used for communication.
This last source was first identified in his research, published in "Science" Magazine.
Recently this method was applied for novel flood warning and monitoring of rain, fog, and humidity.
In order to investigate atmospheric phenomena Alpert devised a method allowing for the identification of the effect by different factors, including separation of synergistic effects.
The atmospheric models applied by Alpert are of three different types: The first is used for study of weather forecasting difficulties, and investigating phenomena such as rain, cyclone genesis, winds, etc.
The second type is of climate models which can be run ~100 years into the future, and with this method Alpert was the first to investigate detailed potential climate changes due to global warming in the Middle-East.
The third type of models focuses on aerosols in the atmosphere, with emphasis on mineral dust mainly from the Sahara and the Middle-East region, as well as sea-salt particles, and their effect on weather and climate.
Alpert has published over 240 articles in scientific peer-reviews journals, and an additional ~100 chapters in books.
In 2011 his book "Factor Separation in the Atmosphere: Applications and Future Prospects" was published by Cambridge Academic Press.
The book describes the factor separation method that he developed since 1993 for investigating interactions in the atmosphere.
The method was adopted globally by many research groups, and the book describes many and various applications.
In 2009 his book "Rain and Wind - meteorology in light of Judaism" (in Hebrew גשם ורוח - מטאורולוגיה בראי היהדות) was published by Rubin Mass press.
In this book Alpert analyses weather phenomena appearing in Jewish literature, provides modern scientific explanations, and ties the literary descriptions to common situations in the climate of Israel.
In 2014 his book "Diary of a Jerusalm Muchtar" (in Hebrew- יומנו של מוכתר בירושלים") was published by Bar-Ilan University publishing house.
The book reproduces the historic journal written by Alpert‘s uncle during the British Mandate, when he served as a ”muchtar", or head of neighborhood, in north Jerusalem.
Alpert had sabbaticals at NASA, where he was given the Goddard Fellow title, as well as in USA and UK universities.
He was invited as a lecturer to the program at Université catholique de Louvain Belgium, the French Meteorological Research Center in Tolouse, and NASA‘s Goddard Space Flight Center.
Alpert was the first Israeli to be awarded the Bjerknes Medal by the European Geosciences Union for 2018, in recognition of his achievements in the field of Atmospheric Sciences.
Shiji Niangniang
Shiji Niangniang () is a goddess in Chinese religion and Taoism.
Before becoming goddess, she was a 10,000-year-old demoness.
It was originally a stone and was born outside the heavens and the earth, during the Chaos era and the Xuanhuang era.
Shiji was originally a major villain from the mythical classic "Compendium of Information on the Gods of the Three Religions" (三教搜神大全), and featured in the Chinese novel "Fengshen Yanyi" as a major antagonist of Nezha.
Shiji was originally a stone, who receives the essence of the sun and the moon, that was born beyond the cosmos and has become a divine spirit by undergoing earth, water, fire and air.
After countless thousands of years, it became spiritual.
After 10,000 years of cultivation, this stubborn stone finally became a human figure.
Shiji was later accepted by the heavenly master Tongtian Jiaozhu as a student.
After attaining Taoism, it took thousands of years to practice.
Although the speed of practice is very slow, because of countless years, Shiji has a profound understanding of Tao.
As far as its comprehensive strength is concerned, it is still above Taiyi Zhenren.
Shiji is a demon leader who is detrimental to the world and opposed the heaven.
She gave birth to the monsters and demons because the world were flooded, the Jade Emperor was furious.
Jade Emperor has ordered Nezha down to earth incarnate demon slayer.
One day, Nezha used the bow and arrow of Rulai to shoot kill Shiji's children, and finally Shiji was also killed with a magic pestle (魔杵).
Shiji lives in the White Bone Cave of Skull Mountain, and there are two apprentices under the gate, Biyun Tongzi and Caiyun Tonger.
One day, Nezha shot an arrow and unexpectedly killed the gatekeeper Biyun Tongzi.
She came to seek revenge Nezha and his father Li Jing to be justified.
Nezha could not beat Shiji and his master Taiyi Zhenren came to protect him.
Taiyi attacked Shiji and burned her with Nine-dragon-fire-net (九龙神火罩).
While trapped in this net, Taiyi summoned several dragons which unleashed a large volley of fire into the net; instantly killing Shiji and turning her back into her original form as a molten rock.
After her death, Jiang Ziya deified Shiji as the Yue Youxingjun (月游星君 "Star of Moon Tour").
Shiji is although on the side of law and order, is depicted as rigid and lacking compassion.
Moreover, although divine, both Ao Guang and, especially, Shiji are demonic figures in the Fengshen Yanyi.
Nezha's crimes against them are accidental, and he defends himself—albeit excessively—from their aggressive attempts to punish him.
In line with preceding argument, one might also view these circumstances as contributing to the author's careful construction of sympathy pathy for Nezha.
Shiji is also related to the stone born from the heaven and earth of Sun Wukong or Jia Baoyu.
Shiji is worshipped in Chinese folk religion and is called "Shiji Niangniang" (the goddess of stone) or "Yue Youxingjun" (the deity of moon tour star).
Located in Caishiji, five miles southwest of Ma'anshan City, the Sanyuan Cave Temple (三元洞) is built with a sitting statue of Shiji.

Hosh el-Kab fort
The Hosh el-Kab fort is a fort in Sudan.
Ruins of a stone fort located on the left bank of the Nile (geographical coordinates 16° 0'37.06 "N, 32° 33'1.16" E, EPSG: 3857), in Khartoum State (Sudan), at a distance of 40 km from the place where the waters of the White Nile meet with the Blue Nile.
The enclosure was erected in the 2nd half of the 6th century AD.
At that time, the region was under the Alwan rule.
It is the largest known regular fort in the Middle Nile Valley.
It was built of stones bonded with mud mortar.
It is quadrilateral in layout with internal dimensions measuring 97x88 meters.
Thirteen bastions reinforced the walls, located in the corners and at regular intervals along the curtains.
Two gates led to the fort, one from the riverside (from the east), the other from the desert (from the west).
In 2018, the fort curtains were preserved to a height of about 0.7 meters.
Geophysical research conducted in 2018 proved that there are numerous structures erected along the inner faces of the walls as well as free-standing buildings.
The fort was inhabited until the mid-seventh century.
Afterward, it was no longer maintained.
It was abandoned for approx.
1000 years.
During the Funj period (16th-19th centuries), a small group settled in the ruins of the fort.
Traces of buildings and stone structures from this period can be found mainly in the south-eastern part of the enclosure.
Some of them were built directly on the ruins of the defenses.
In 2018, the place was abandoned.
The proximity of the Nile (a distance of about 500 meters) makes the area attractive to local farmers.
This is evidenced by a 10-meters wide irrigation channel, which was dug in 2013/2014 across the fort.
Street children in Ukraine
Street children in Ukraine are underage individuals who live and survive in Ukrainian streets without attendance and care of adults.
As a rule they are dwelling in landfills, public transit stations, junkyards, or under the bridges of major cities.
The country's legal system defines the term "street children" as children who either left their family or have been abandoned by their parents.
Violence against them is considered to be a widespread and serious national problem because in Ukraine they can become victims of commercial sexual exploitation, police violence, civil rights abuses and human trafficking.
In 1991 Ukraine proclaimed its independence after collapse of the Soviet Union.
The process was followed by transition to free market economy and rapid social changes, like impoverishment of population, high unemployment, and subsequently — sky-rocketing juvenile delinquency, wide spread of street drugs and adolescent suicides during the mid-1990s.
Living on the streets exposes the youngsters to a wide number of risk factors, and due to their effect the great part of the infants falls behind in the schooling.
The main risks of street life in Ukraine are physical and sexual violence, drug abuse, malnutrition, police abuse and harassment, risky sexual activity, forced sex, unintended pregnancy, and different kinds of infections, like HIV, tuberculosis, STDs and hepatitis.
The risks contribute to the psychological and emotional condition of the street youngsters instigating among them traumatism, depressions, sense of isolation, and insufficient self-esteem.
In addition, their opportunities to make a living are very limited by beggary, collection of empty bottles and so on.
As a result their everyday surviving can be characterized as deviation from the ethical norms of the civil society since the street children tend to be inclined to criminal activities (theft, robbery and property damage), vagrancy, substance abuse and prostitution regardless of their gender.
It was reported that the use of drugs among Ukrainian homeless minors acquired a special meaning of symbolic ritual.
In order to strengthen their subgroup solidarity they have developed a ceremony to inject a so called "baltrushka" (mixture of vinegar, water and flu medicine) up to six times a day.
Another popular method of drug taking in Ukraine is inhaling glue.
The uncontrolled use of injection drugs, sharing needles and unprotected sex make the street children extremely vulnerable to HIV.
The spread of HIV among the Ukrainian street children attracted a lot of special research interest due to their way of life.
The available data show that the street children and youth of the major cities make up about 33 % of total population at risk.
Testing of HIV samples collected in different Ukrainian cities demonstrates that HIV prevalence among street children may be as high as 50 %.
According to the obtained data around 15.5% of street minors in Ukraine used the injected drugs at least once, 9.8% of boys reported anal sex experience when only 36 % of them acknowledged using condom during their most recent sexual encounter.
An access of the street minors to public health services in Ukraine is a serious problem too due to cumbersome bureaucratic protocol and negative attitude of the medical personnel to the homeless people.
Some providers of the health services may refuse to treat them or provide just a limited treatment only in life-threatening condirion.
Ukrainian Police for Minors treats the street children as "potential criminals".
The police attitude towards the youngsters may include sexual harassment and physical violence.
According to some reports around 75 % of the Ukrainian street children have experienced a harassment from the police and 41 % have been harassed more than tree times in the past year.
Unfortunately, official data about a total number of street children in Ukraine are not available.
As a result, there is a huge range of different evaluations between 30,000 and 300,000.
An assessment of Ukrainian Ministry of Health indicated that there is around 115,000 of adolescents aged 10—18 who need a protection.
Nevertheless, there is no doubts that their number went up significantly during last 17 years.
As of 2003, the Ukrainian government estimated their number of 50,000 using data collected from street shelters.
A main factor, which pushes the minors to the street life is an extreme poverty of Ukrainian population.
The adults has to work longer hours or seek for employment in neighbor countries, while their children are being left unattended.
Other factors are widespread alcoholism and substance abuse, physical or sexual violence and ignoring the parenting responsibilities within their families.
A survey of Ukrainian children in the age before 15 demonstrated that around 66 % of them used to live with an alcoholic or illegal drug user, 60 % have separated or divorced parents, 54 % witnessed violence of intimate partner, around 50% experienced violence against themselves, 41 % lived with ex-prisoners of Ukrainian penitentiary system, 38 % lived with someone who was mentally sick or tried to commit suicide.
1999–2000 West Midlands (Regional) League

MK285
The MK285 is an airburst grenade that can be fired from certain 40 mm belt-fed automatic grenade launchers.
The grenade was designed for the Mk 47 grenade launcher.
The Mk 47 is a candidate for replacing the Mark 19 grenade launcher, first fielded in 1968, and still in widespread service, around the world.
The Mk 47 is considerably lighter than the Mk 19, is designed to fire all the same suite of grenades as the Mk 19, together with more modern grenades the Mk 19 could not fire, like the MK285 grenade.
The MK285 contains a programmable fuse, designed by Bofors, that sets the distance at which the grenade will explode, when the weapon's trigger is pulled.
The weapon's computerized sight will have measured the distance to the target the gunner was aiming at, and that distance will be transferred to the grenade's fuse.
The munition spins, on its way to the target, and the fuse counts rotations to measure the distance travelled.
This airburst capability means that the grenade can damage or disable soft targets, like trucks, with a near miss.
It also means the grenade can injure or kill soldiers who are behind walls or in trenches, through indirect fire, who could not be hurt by more conventional grenades that exploded when hitting those walls.
The manufacturer characterizes the grenade as a weapon that can hit around corners.
As of 2015 the Mk 19 remained the frontline grenade launcher used by the US military.
Limited numbers of Mk 47 weapons had been issued to special forces units.
The grenade is manufactured by the Norwegian firm Nammo Raufoss.
The explosive in the grenade is classed as "insensitive" - ie.
less likely to sympathetically explode due to the nearby explosion of other munitions.

125 Group
The 125 Group is a volunteer run charity in England dedicated to the preservation of the InterCity 125s and specifically, Class 43 powercars.
Its aims are:
The 125 Group was founded in 1994 at a time when the InterCity 125 remained in daily use and under no threat of withdrawal, in 2006 it purchased 10 Paxman Valenta engines when the majority of the Class 43 powercars were repowered with a view to restoring some to original condition when withdrawn.
In 2011, it reached an agreement with the National Railway Museum to become the custodian of Class 41 prototype powercar 41001 and restore it to operational condition at Neville Hill TMD.
This work was completed in 2014, with 41001 based at the Great Central Railway (Nottingham).
The 125 Group purchased a number of Mark 3 carriages to operate with it.
In 2019, the National Railway Museum terminated the lease of 41001.
Upon withdrawal in early 2020, former East Midlands Railway Class 43 powercars 43048 and 43089 will be donated by Porterbrook to the 125 Group.
In order to support its ongoing preservation efforts, an appeal was launched to raise £100,000 for a depot building to be located at its current base of operations, Great Central Railway (Nottingham).
As of January 2020, this total stood at over £88,000.

Foreign involvement in the Yemeni Civil War
During the Yemeni civil war, Saudi Arabia led an Arab coalition of nine nations from the Middle East and parts of Africa in response to calls from the internationally recognized pro-Saudi president of Yemen Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi for military support after he was ousted by the Houthi movement due to economic and political grievances, and fled to Saudi Arabia.
Nations such as the United Kingdom and the United States support the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen primarily through arms sales and technical assistance.
France had also made recent military sales to Saudi Arabia.
MSF emergency coordinator Karline Kleijer called the US, France and the UK part of the Saudi-led coalition, which imposed the weapons embargo and blocked all ships from entering Yemen with supplies.
Human rights groups have criticized the countries for supplying arms, and accuse the coalition of using cluster munitions, which are banned in most countries.
Oxfam pointed out that Germany, Iran, and Russia have also reportedly sold arms to the conflicting forces.
Tariq Riebl, head of programmes in Yemen for Oxfam, said, "it's difficult to argue that a weapon sold to Saudi Arabia would not in some way be used in Yemen," or "if it's not used in Yemen it enables the country to use other weapons in Yemen."
Amnesty International urged the US and the UK to stop supplying arms to Saudi Arabia and to the Saudi-led coalition.
It called on the international community, including the United States and United Kingdom to stop "providing arms that could be used in the conflict in Yemen".
On August 3, 2019, a United Nations report said the US, UK and France may be complicit in committing war crimes in Yemen by selling weapons and providing support to the Saudi-led coalition which is using the deliberate starvation of civilians as a tactic of warfare.
The coalition accused Iran of militarily and financially supporting the Houthis.
On 9 April US secretary of state John Kerry said there were "obviously supplies that have been coming from Iran", with "a number of flights every single week that have been flying in", and warned Iran to stop its alleged support of the Houthis.
Iran denied these claims.
Anti-Houthi fighters defending Aden claimed they captured two officers in the IranianQuds Force on 11 April, who had purportedly been serving as military advisers to the Houthi militias in the city.
This claim was not repeated.
Iran denied presence of any Iranian military force.
According to Michael Horton, an expert on Yemeni affairs, the notion that the Houthis are an Iranian proxy is "nonsense".
According to the AFP, a confidential report presented to the Security Council's Iran sanctions committee in April 2015 claimed that Iran had been shipping weapons to the Houthi rebels since between 2009 and 2013.
The panel further noted the absence of reports of any weapon shipments since 2013.
On 2 May, Abdollahian said that Tehran would not let regional powers jeopardize its security interests.
According to American officials, Iran discouraged Houthi rebels from taking over the Yemeni capital in late 2014, casting further doubt on claims that the rebels were fighting a proxy war on behalf of Iran.
A spokeswoman for the US National Security Council said that it remained the council's assessment that "Iran does not exert command and control over the Houthis in Yemen."
On 6 May Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said, "The Americans shamelessly support the killing of the Yemeni population, but they accuse Iran of interfering in that country and of sending weapons when Iran only seeks to provide medical and food aid."
On 26 September 2015, Saudi Arabia alleged that an Iranian fishing boat loaded with weapons, including rockets and anti-tank shells, was intercepted and seized in the Arabian Sea, southeast of the Omani Port of Salalah, by Arab coalition forces.
In May 2019, Houthi militias launched two attacks to two pumping stations managed by Saudi Aramco.
Anas AlHajji, an oil expert, said that such an attack is planned to damage the said pipelines as they replace the Strait of Hormuz's oil passages.
In March 2015, President Barack Obama declared that he had authorized US forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a "Joint Planning Cell" with Saudi Arabia.
This includes aerial refueling permitting coalition aircraft more loitering time over Yemen, and permitting some coalition members to home base aircraft rather than relocate them to Saudi Arabia.
According to press reporting, many in US SOCOM reportedly favor Houthis, as they have been effective at combating al-Qaeda and recently ISIL, "something that hundreds of US drone strikes and large numbers of advisers to Yemen's military had failed to accomplish".
According to a senior CENTCOM commander, "the reason the Saudis didn't inform us of their plans is because they knew we would have told them exactly what we think—that it was a bad idea."
As Yemen expert Michael Horton puts it, the US had been "Iran's air force in Iraq", and "al-Qaeda's air force in Yemen".
According to an Al Jazeera report, one reason for US support may be the diplomatic logic of tamping down SA's opposition to the Iranian nuclear deal by backing them.
Another is the view among some US military commanders that countering Iran took strategic priority over combating Al-Qaeda and ISIL.
On 30 June an HRW report stated that US-made bombs were being used in attacks indiscriminately targeting civilians and violating the laws of war.
The report photographed "the remnants of an MK-83 air-dropped 1,000-pound bomb made in the US".
US Representative Ted Lieu has been publicly raising concerns over US support for Saudi-led war in Yemen.
In March 2016, he sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Ash Carter.
He wrote in the letter that the "apparent indiscriminate airstrikes on civilian targets in Yemen seem to suggest that either the coalition is grossly negligent in its targeting or is intentionally targeting innocent civilians".
Following American concern about civilian casualties in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, the US military involvement is mostly ineffective due to coalition's airstrikes targeting civilian and hospitals.
In 2015 the United States deployed The Green Berets to assist the Saudi Arabian military with missile interception.
A March 2016 Human Rights Watch report states that US participation in specific military operations, such as selecting targets and aerial refueling during Saudi air raids "may make US forces jointly responsible for laws-of-war violations by coalition forces".
In September "The Guardian" reported that one in three bombing raids hit civilian sites.
On 13 October 2016, fired Tomahawk missiles at Houthi-controlled radar sites "in the Dhubab district of Taiz province, a remote area overlooking the Bab al-Mandab Straight known for fishing and smuggling."
In 2017 the United States sent a total of $599,099,937 of foreign aid to Yemen despite being a supporter of the Saudi led military intervention.
US Secretary of Defense James Mattis asked President Donald Trump to remove restrictions on US military support for Saudi Arabia.
In February 2017, Mattis wanted to intercept and board an Iranian ship in the Arabian Sea to look for contraband weapons, which would have constituted an "act of war".
In April 2017, Justin Amash, Walter Jones and other members of Congress criticized US involvement in Saudi Arabian military campaign in Yemen, highlighting that Al Qaeda in Yemen "has emerged as a de facto ally of the Saudi-led militaries with whom [Trump] administration aims to partner more closely".
In November 2017, US Senator Chris Murphy accused the United States of complicity in Yemen's humanitarian catastrophe.
In December 2017, the Trump administration urged restraint in the Saudi military action in Yemen, as well as in Qatar and Lebanon.
US bombs used by the coalition have killed Yemeni civilians throughout 2018, including a Lockheed Martin made bomb that struck a school bus in August, killing 51 people.
In the wake of Jamal Khashoggi's murder in October 2018, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the US Secretary of Defense James Mattis have called for a ceasefire in Yemen within 30 days followed by UN-initiated peace talks.
Pompeo has asked Saudi Arabia and the UAE to stop their airstrikes on populated areas in Yemen.
President of the International Rescue Committee David Miliband called the US announcement as "the most significant breakthrough in the war in Yemen for four years".
The US continues its support of the Saudi-led intervention with weapons sales and intelligence sharing.
On 10 November 2018, the US announced it would no longer refuel coalition aircraft operating over Yemen.
On 13 December, the US Senate voted to end US military assistance to Saudi Arabia over alleged war crimes in Yemen.
Following the 56-to-41 vote in the US Senate to invoke the War Powers Resolution and to end US military support to Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon presented a bill of $331 million to Saudis and Emiratis for US' support in the Yemen Civil War.
The bill was split between $36.8 million for fuel and $294.3 million for US flight hours.
The Pentagon stated that Saudi Arabia has not made any payments since the beginning of the war.
In April 2019, Trump vetoed a bipartisan bill which would have ended US support for the Saudi-led military intervention.
With 53 votes instead of the 67 needed, the United States Senate failed to override the veto.
The legal arguments and policies of the Obama administration were cited as justification for the veto.
The US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Mulroy stated that US support was limited to side-by-side coaching to mitigate civilian casualties and if the measure had passed it would do nothing to help the people of Yemen and may only increase civilian deaths.
Mulroy supported the United Nation's peace talks and he pushed the international community to come together and chart a comprehensive way ahead for Yemen.
Writing in "The Nation", Mohamad Bazzi argued that Mulroy's defence of US support as necessary to limit civilian casualties was false, and that "Saudi leaders and their allies have ignored American entreaties to minimize civilian casualties since the war’s early days".
The UK is one of the largest suppliers of arms to Saudi Arabia, and London immediately expressed strong support for the Saudi-led campaign.
Six months into the bombing, Oxfam said the UK was "quietly fuelling the Yemen conflict and exacerbating one of the world's worst humanitarian crises" by keeping its arms pipeline to Saudi Arabia open; the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) agreed that "UK arms and UK cooperation have been central to the devastation of Yemen."
In mid-September 2015, the deputy chief executive of Oxfam complained that the government even refused to reveal to Parliament the details of the 37 arms export licences it had granted for sales to Saudi Arabia since March that year.
The attack on Yemen saw sales of UK bombs for 2015 increase from £9m to over £1bn in three months.
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have shown that UK arms are being used on civilian targets.
Furthermore, the UK government has been repeatedly accused of violating domestic, EU, and international law, in particular the Arms Trade Treaty, by maintaining its flow of weapons to the Kingdom.
Despite this, it was reported in November 2015 that the UK planned a number of high-level visits to Saudi Arabia over the following three to six months with the aim of securing major arms deals.
In January 2016, it emerged that UK military advisors were assisting Saudi personnel in the selection of targets.
On 2 February 2016, the International Development Select Committee finally added its call for the UK to cease exporting arms to Saudi Arabia and to end its opposition to an independent international inquiry into the way the military campaign had been conducted thus far.
The committee's call went unheeded; indeed, just weeks later, on the day the EU held a non-binding vote in favour of an arms embargo on the country because of its destructive bombing of Yemen, Prime Minister David Cameron boasted about the "brilliant" arms, components, and other military technology that the UK would continue to sell to Saudi Arabia, Oman, and other Gulf states.
Angus Robertson, the SNP's Parliamentary Group Leader, said David Cameron should admit to British involvement in Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen: "Isn't it time for the Prime Minister to admit that Britain is effectively taking part in a war in Yemen that is costing thousands of civilians lives and he has not sought parliamentary approval to do this?"
A few months later, leading American security expert Bruce Riedel noted: "If the United States and the United Kingdom, tonight, told King Salman [of Saudi Arabia] 'this war has to end,' it would end tomorrow.
The Royal Saudi Air Force cannot operate without American and British support."
As well as supplying materiel and targeting support for the bombing of Yemen, the UK has assisted the coalition diplomatically.
For example, the UK response, provided by Middle East Minister Tobias Ellwood, to the leaked report of a UN panel in January 2016, which documented more than one hundred instances of coalition air strikes that had violated international law, was to say that the Saudis had made "mistakes" and claim that other cases may have been "fabricated" by the Houthis.
Theresa May succeeded David Cameron as prime minister in July 2016, but maintained her predecessor's policy because, she claimed, close ties with the Saudis "keep people on the streets of Britain safe".
In September 2016, her foreign minister, Boris Johnson, refused to block UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia, saying there remained no clear evidence of breaches of international humanitarian law by Saudi Arabia in the war in Yemen, and that it would be best for Saudi Arabia to investigate itself.
Amid reports from Yemen of famine conditions and "emaciated children [...] fighting for their lives", CAAT observed that the notion of self-investigation would rightly never pass muster if it were proposed for Russia's bombing in support of Assad in Syria.
Indeed, in October 2016, Boris Johnson commended the notion of referring allegations of Russian and Russian-backed war crimes to the International Court of Justice.
The previous month, Johnson had rejected a proposal for the UN Human Rights Council to conduct an inquiry into the war in Yemen.
Furthermore, Britain blocked such an inquiry from taking place.
In October 2016, it emerged that the United Kingdom was continuing to provide instruction to pilots of the Royal Saudi Air Force, both in the UK and in Saudi Arabia.
Andrew Mitchell, the former cabinet minister in David Cameron's government, stated that "Britain is complicit in creating" a famine in Yemen.
On 24 March 2019, The British newspaper "The Mail on Sunday" reported that some British soldiers have been involved in gun battles with, and been wounded by, Houthi fighters.
According to the report at least five members of the SBS have been wounded.
A SBS source told "The Mail", "The guys are fighting in the inhospitable desert and mountainous terrain against highly committed and well-equipped Houthi rebels, The SBS's role is mainly training and mentoring but on occasions, they have found themselves in firefights and some British troops have been shot".
The report also claims that British Special Forces are fighting on the same side as jihadists and militia which use child soldiers.
After the report, The shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, questioned these allegations in the British parliament suggesting that the British forces may have been witnesses to war crimes, if the allegations were true.
She claimed that as many as 40% of the soldiers in the Saudi coalition were children, a breach of international humanitarian law.
In response, the UK Foreign Office minister Mark Field called the allegations "very serious and well sourced" and promised to get to the bottom of these allegations.
On 25 March 2019 Mark Lancaster told the UK parliament that Britain's Royal Air Force (RAF) was providing "engineering support" and "generic training" to Saudi Arabian military.
According to the Guardian News agency, more than 40 Saudi officers have been trained at prestigious British military colleges since the Saudi intervention in Yemen started.
This officers mostly trained at Sandhurst, the RAF’s school at Cranwell and the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth since 2015.
The MoD refused to state the earned money from the Saudi contracts, because it could influence Britain’s relations with the Saudis.
Abdul-Malik Badreddin, The Houthi leader condemned the UK military cooperation and arms sales to Saudi military.
According to a Sky News analysis, The UK has sold at least £5.7bn worth of arms to the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen since 2015.
Priyanka Motaparthy, senior emergencies researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: “These revelations confirm once again how the UK military is working hand in glove with the Saudis.
France is also a significant arms supplier to Saudi Arabia.
It has supplied over 2 billion dollars including armoured vehicles, air defence systems, and aircraft subsystems.
France has also supplied the UAE with arms, despite the UAE and the militias it backs being implicated in war crimes and other serious violations.
On 22 November 2015, "The New York Times" reported the United Arab Emirates had contracted Academi to deploy 450 Colombian, Panamanian, Salvadoran and Chilean mercenaries to Yemen in October.
On 9 December, Australian media reported an Australian mercenary commander was killed in Yemen alongside six Colombian nationals after Houthi fighters and Saleh army units attacked Saudi-led forces in the country's south-west.
Transformativism
Transformativism refers to the method of making a flexible centrist coalition of government which isolated the extremes of the left and the right in Italian politics after the unification and before the rise of Benito Mussolini and Fascism.
The policy was embraced by Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour and the Historical Right upon Italian unification and carried over into the post-Risorgimento liberal state.
Agostino Depretis, the Prime Minister in 1883 who was a member of the Left continued the process.
He moved to the right and reshuffled his government to include Marco Minghetti's Liberal-Conservatives.
This was a move Depretis had been considering for a while.
The aim was to ensure a stable government that would avoid weakening the institutions by extreme shifts to the left or right and ensuring calm in Italy.
At this time, middle class politicians were concerned more with making deals with one another rather than with political philosophies and principles.
Large coalitions were formed with members being bribed to join them.
The Liberals, the main political group, was tied together by informal gentleman's agreements, but these were always in matters of enriching themselves.
Actual governing did not seem to be happening at all, but limited franchise led to politicians not having to concern themselves with the interests of their constituents.
One of the most successful politicians was Giovanni Giolitti, who succeeded in becoming Prime Minister on five different occasions over twenty years.
Under his influence the Liberals did not develop as a structured party, instead being a series of informal personal groupings with no formal links to political constituencies.
However, "trasformismo" fed into the debates that the Italian parliamentary system was weak and actually failing and it ultimately became associated with corruption.
It was perceived as a sacrifice of principles and policies for short term gain.
The system of "trasformismo" was little loved and seemed to be creating a huge gap between politicians and their constituents.
This system brought almost no advantages, as illiteracy remained the same in 1912 as before the unification era, and backward economic policies combined with poor sanitary conditions continued to prevent the country's rural areas from improving.
Drawing upon Antonio Gramsci's observations of Italian politics and history, Canadian historian Ian McKay has suggested that "trasformismo" has also played an important role in Canadian politics.
The MacDonald–Cartier coalition, the basis of the Conservative Party which dominated Canadian federal politics for most of the latter half of the 19th century and the Liberal Party which had dominated Canadian politics for the 20th century, are portrayed as examples of a Canadian variant of "trasformismo".
In the 1930s, Professor Frank H. Underhill of the University of Toronto also argued that Canada's two major political parties, the Liberals and the Conservatives, had operated in similar ways, advancing the same policies appealing to the same variety of sectional/regional and class interests.
In doing so, Canada had perfected the two-party system and had marginalized liberalism and radicalism.
Underhill argued the result was a pervasive poverty in Canadian political culture.
Not coincidentally, Underhill was centrally involved in the formation of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, a farmer-labour coalition born during the Great Depression which became Canada's first successful federal third party, the social democratic New Democratic Party.

Lac des Martres (Lac-Pikauba)
The lac aux Martres is a body of water on the hydrographic side of the rivières des Martres and the Saguenay River via a succession of lakes and ruisseau des Érables.
It is located in the unorganized territory of Lac-Pikauba, in the Charlevoix Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Capitale-Nationale, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
The southern part of Lac aux Martres is served indirectly by the route 381 (north-south direction) which runs along the eastern limit of the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve.
Several other secondary forest roads serve the lake sector for forestry and recreational tourism activities.
Forestry is the main economic activity in the sector; recreational tourism, second.
The surface of Lac aux Martres is usually frozen from the end of November to the beginning of April, however the safe circulation on the ice is generally done from mid-December to the end of March.
Lac des Martres is located between the territory of Hautes-Gorges-de-la-Rivière-Malbaie and that of Grands-Jardins National Park.
The main hydrographic slopes neighboring Lac aux Martres are:
Lac aux Martres has a length of in the shape of a boat anchor, a maximum width of , an altitude is and an area of .
Lac aux Martres has a relatively round peninsula with a maximum diameter of and with a mountain peak reaching .
A dam is built at its mouth which is located on the east bank, at:
From the mouth of Lac aux Martres, the current descends the ruisseau des Érables for to the northeast, then the northwest, to "Anse aux Cailles" on the south shore of the Saguenay River; then the current descends to the east the Saguenay River on to Tadoussac where the latter river flows into the Saint Lawrence river.
The toponym “Lac des Martres” is indicated in the “Dictionary of rivers and lakes of the province of Quebec”, by Eugène Rouillard, Department of Lands and Forests, 1914, page 270.
This work indicates that the land surveyor, F Vincent, in 1886, described it as being located in mountainous terrain, surrounded by fir and spruce; it also notes the presence of trout in its waters.
This name evokes the presence of the Canada marten, carnivorous mammal also called fisher, whose fur has long adorned the collars of coats.
The toponym "Lac aux Martres" was formalized on December 5, 1968 by the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

Source (programming language)
Source is a family of sublanguages of JavaScript, developed for the textbook Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JavaScript Adaptation (SICP JS).
The JavaScript sublanguages Source §1, Source §2, Source §3 and Source §4 are designed to be just powerful enough to support all examples of the respective chapter of the textbook.
During the development of SICP JS, starting in 2008, it became clear that purpose-designed sublanguages of JavaScript would contribute to the learning experience.
Initially called "JediScript" and inspired by , Douglas Crockford, the Source sublanguages follow the chapters of SICP JS; each language Source §x is a sublanguage of the next language Source §(x+1).
Source §1 is a very small purely functional sublanguage of JavaScript, designed for Chapter 1 of SICP JS.
Source §2 adds pairs and a list library, following the data structures theme of Chapter 2.
Source §3 adds state-full constructs, and Source §4 adds support for meta-circular evaluation.
Chapter 5 of SICP JS does not require language support beyond Source §4.
All Source languages are properly tail recursive, as required by Chapter 1 of SICP and as specified by ECMAScript 2016.
Since the Safari browser is ECMAScript 2016 compliant, including proper tail calls, it can serve as an implementation of all Source languages, provided that the necessary libraries are loaded.
The Source Academy is a web-based programming environment that implements all Source languages, regardless of browser support for proper tail calls, and features various tools for the readers of SICP JS.
The language implementation in the Source Academy is an open-source project.
Tourism in Niger
There is relatively limited tourism in Niger.
Most of the tourism industry is in the north, where the city of Agadez allows access to the desert.
Other places that see tourism are the capital city, Niamey, areas around the Niger River, and reserves such as Kouré which is known for West African giraffes.
Tourism in Northern Niger started to develop in the 1970s.
Tourism dropped during the Tuareg rebellion in the early 90s.
There has recently been travel warnings to the Niger because of terrorism as a result of the insurgency in the Sahel.
Condução coercitiva
Condução coercitiva is a compulsory method of bringing subjects of a judicial process, victims, witnesses, accused parties, or expert subjects into the presence of law enforcement or judicial authorities against their wishes.
This is a measure provided for in the Penal Code of Brazil (CPP) as a means of compelling the appearance of a person to attend an action to which he was summoned, but who failed to do so without justification.
According to some jurists, this is a form of short-term "precautionary detention" () whose purpose is to ensure the convenience of the production of proof.
If equated with precautionary detention, is contrary to the Brazilian Constitution of 1988 Article 5, paragraph LXI, even though the procedure is in the Penal Code of Brazil, instituted in 1941.
The CPP authorizes the enforcement of the of victims, witnesses, defendants, and experts who refuse to appear in court, and who may even be handcuffed and brought by police vehicle.
Article 218 of the CPP refers to the requirement of prior summons ().
Thus, some argue that even with the justification of providing clarification to the police investigation and even in the interests of justice, the warrant without a summons violates the right to liberty of witnesses and defendants.
According to this line of thinking, the only ones who can be compelled to appear by a are those witnesses who were appropriately summoned beforehand and who fail to attend the act to which they were summoned, without valid cause, may be compelled to appear via a warrant.
There is some controversy concerning the exact legal foundation and even constitutionality of the warrant.
From a legal perspective, it is not the same as an arrest warrant.

Abu Nafisa fort
Abu Nafisa fort is a ruin located on the left bank of the Nile, in Khartoum Province (Sudan).
Geographic coordinates of the site, in the EPSG 3857 are 16° 0'50.11" N, 32° 33'14.47" E. Fort was built by the rulers of Alwa.
The enclosure in quadrilateral in layout with internal dimensions measuring 83x78 meters.
In three corners in 2018, traces of bastions have survived.
In the fourth corner, south-eastern, there was a much younger oval tomb of Sheikh Abu Nafisa, dated to the last centuries of the Funj Sultanate (18th-19th century).
The name of the site comes from this individual
The fort was built in the 2nd half of the 6th century AD and was used for a short period.
At the same time, a similar fort Hosh el-Kab was built 500 meters from Abu Nafisa.
Fort Abu Nafisa, unlike Hosh el-Kab, was erected too close to the river, so the high floods that occasionally occur have been damaging the architecture.
Currently, areas surrounding Abu Nafisa fort are cultivated and every now and then they are flooded.
The last flooding of the Nile, which reached the walls of the fort, took place in April 2019.
Satellite imagery from Google Earth shows the site being periodically underwater.

The first encounter was played on 30 March 2019 at Borg El Arab Stadium and ended goalless.
Al Ahly won the second encounter 1–0 which was played on 28 July 2019 at the same stadium thanks to Ali Maâloul's second-half strike.
The third encounter was the previous season's super cup, which was played on 20 September 2019 and also at Borg El Arab Stadium.
Al Ahly won the match 3–2 with two goals from Junior Ajayi and one from Hussein El Shahat, while Mahmoud Alaa scored a brace of penalties for Zamalek.

The Hand of Destiny
The Hand of Destiny is a short story C.S.
Forester wrote about his most popular character, Horatio Hornblower, written in 1940, and published in "Collier's magazine".
Sanford Sternlicht, author of "C. S. Forester and the Hornblower Saga" notes the story has multiple inconsistencies with later stories.
He also notes elements of the story that Forester re-used, in later stories.
In the story Hornblower is 20 years old, and has just been promoted to Lieutenant.
Sternlicht places the story in late 1796.
Forester has Hornblower recently transferred from serving under Edward Pellew, the genuine naval hero who is Hornblower's first mentor.
But Sternlicht notes that in "Mr Midshipman Hornblower" Hornblower serves under Pellew until 1797.
"The Hand of Destiny" has Hornblower serving on board the fictional HMS "Marguerite", under despotic Captain Courtney.
In the short story Hornblower is shocked by Courtney's cruelty.
Courtney has goaded some of his men to revolt.
Hornblower is assigned to negotiate with the rebellious sailors.
Courtney is careless in the instructions he gives Hornblower, and is very angry with him when Hornblower promises them Courtney will not retaliate against them.
Courtney plans to brutally punish the men without regard to Hornblower's assurances to them.
A battle forces a delay in Courtney's plans.
Hornblower leads the rebellious sailors in boarding the hostile Spanish warship, the "Castilla".
Courtney is pleased with Hornblower, and assigns him the task of sailing the captured vessel to port.
Hornblower seizes the opportunity that, instead of punishing the alleged mutineers he assign them to serve as his prize crew.
Sternlicht notes that Forester re-used the premise of Hornblower angering a senior officer whose instructions gave him the leeway to be lenient with mutineers.
Forester wrote the Hornblower stories out of order.
"Beat to Quarters", set in 1810, the first Hornblower novel, takes place relatively late in his career.
In Chapter IX Hornblower dons his dress uniform, when preparing to meet an important person.
His preparation includes strapping on his dress sword, ""(a sword of the value of fifty guineas, the gift of the Patriotic Fund for Lieutenant Hornblower's part in the capture of the Castilla six years ago)"".
In Chapter XIII Hornblower is embarrassed when Lady Barbara admires his hands, which he thinks are ugly.
In particular he is embarrassed by an ""ingrained powder stain"" on his left hand, dating to his leading the boarding party that captured the "Castilla".
Forester's second and third novels, "A Ship of the Line", and "Flying Colours" also refer to the sword he was awarded for his role in the capture of the "Castilla".
In the fifth novel, "Lord Hornblower", an older Hornblower reminds himself that he remains the brave officer who lead the boarding of the "Castilla".
Sternlicht notes that the eighth novel Forester wrote, "HMS "Atropos", set in 1805-1806, contains a completely different account of the capture of the "Castilla".
In that novel Hornblower is a junior Post-Captain, and the capture occurs off the coast of Turkey.
Robert Salisbury (educationalist)
Sir Robert Salisbury is an educationalist, and a "leading expert" on education funding.
He has an international reputation for his ideas on leadership styles and staff motivation.
He is most noted for transforming a failing secondary school in a pit village in Nottinghamshire into a "beacon of success" at the heart of its community, winning a number of awards and attracting a stream of famous visitors.
Until 2001, he was a Professor in the School of Education at Nottingham University.
Before that he was head teacher at The Garibaldi School in Forest Town, Mansfield, Notts.
When he was appointed head teacher there in 1989, the school had a poor reputation and unmotivated staff.
His five-year plan turned the school round, and by 1993 Salisbury had become recognised as a successful entrepreneur.
In 1998, Salisbury was knighted for his work in Education.
In 2011 he led an enquiry into numeracy and literacy at schools in Northern Ireland.
In 2013, he reviewed the funding of schools in Northern Ireland for the Northern Ireland department for education.
His review claimed that there was "a long rump of under-achievement in Northern Ireland", and that "Northern Ireland has too many small schools and too many types of school which can no longer be funded".
In or before 2015, he was asked to review further education colleges.
In 2019, he was criticised by the DUP MP Ian Paisley for "dismissing a significant number of high-achieving young adults in Northern Ireland", when he described some of the top schools in Northern Ireland as "Exam factories".
Robert Salisbury was born in Newton Drive Stapleford and moved to Warren Ave when aged eleven.
He and his wife Rosemary now live in County Tyrone, where they have spent 15 years converting 17 acres of barren fields into a wildlife refuge.
Abraham Munting
Abraham Munting (19 June 1626 Groningen - 31 January 1683 Groningen) was a Dutch botanist and botanical artist, the son of (1583-1658).
He studied under his father and at the universities of Franeker, Utrecht and Leiden, also spending two years in France where he obtained an M.D.
degree in Angers.
Returning to Groningen in 1651, he joined the staff at the Rijkshogeschool Groningen, which eventually became the University of Groningen.
Here he taught for 24 years as professor of botany and chemistry.
On his father's death he assumed management of the "Hortus Botanicus Groninganus", from 1658 to 1683.
His botanist friends sent him seeds from the Dutch East- and West Indies, Africa and the Americas.
His daughter, Hester, died after eating Deadly Nightshade from the Garden.
Munting subsequently developed a particular interest in the medicinal uses of plants.
Munting's best known work "Naauwkeurige Beschryving Der Aardgewassen" (1696), was published after his death and is an improved version of earlier editions of "Waare Oeffening der Planten".
The work enjoyed popularity, partly because of its departure from traditional botanical illustration, in that plant species were depicted against a background of classic or pastoral landscapes, often floating in midair with little regard for perspective and relative sizes.
Illustrated were trees, shrubs, flowers, and grasses of temperate zones, with some tropical and subtropical plants that had been introduced to the Netherlands.
Albrecht von Haller (1708-1777) criticised some of the plates as being of suspicious authenticity.
In 1702 the work was translated into Latin by Franz Kiggelaer.
After his death in 1683 his son Albert Munting took over the running of the Garden.
The genus "Muntingia" (1753) was named by Linnaeus in honour of Munting.

The party was officially registered on 22 January 1981.
Clavero was the party's president, whereas Manuel Otero Luna was elected as secretary general.
An electoral coalition with the conservative People's Alliance (AP) was considered ahead of the 1982 Andalusian regional election, but in the end it was rejected and the party chose not to contest the election out of a lack of campaign funding.
It also unsuccessfully probed a coalition with Adolfo Suárez's Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) ahead of the 1982 Spanish general election.
In the end, the party was dissolved on 27 November 1982 over a lack of political and economical viability.

CSX Transportation still uses this line daily as it's Middletown Subdivision of the Louisville Division.
The B&O itself merged with the C&O in 1987, which itself became part of CSX Transportation in that year.
Brian Tonna
Brian Tonna is a Maltese businessmann and private accountant.
He is suspected of illegal money transfers and part of the political crises up from 2019 in Malta.
Brian Tonna ran "Brian Tonna & Co.", described by the project managing tool "timesheet express" as a "medium sized accounting and audit firm based in Malta with their primary objective of satisfying clients needs in a professional and cost effective manner."
The company was member of Nexia International, a worldwide network of independent auditors, business advisers and consultants.
"Brian Tonna’s clients can access international expertise in a broad range of accounting and tax specialists in countries around the world."
In May 2013 Tonna created a Maltese subsidiary of Mossack Fonseca, "Nexia BT".
Brian Tonna has known businessman and öater Muscat chef of staff Keith Schembri as a personal friend and client in 2019 for 20 years, according to a written declaration made by Tonna and seen by Reuters.
After Joseph Muscat won the Maltese election in 2013, Tonna, like Keith Schembri and others became inoffical part of his office team.
Die Zeit called him "a kind of chief accountant" in the system of legal and illegal business involment of politicians.
Tonna was officially hired as an adviser to Owen Bonnici, the than minister for justice in Malta.
The work was in addition to previously disclosed business contracts, worth more than 800.000 Euros, awarded by other government ministries to NexiaBT.
Brian Tonna held the consultancy full-time from August 2014 to August 2016, and part-time from then until August 31, 2017, contracts, obtained from a Freedom of Information request.
Reuters wrote, Tonnas pay of about 55.000 Euros annually plus expenses was almost as high as that of the prime minister of Malta.
Ten days after Muscats election in 2013 Tonna founded via Mossack Fonseca in Panama the "Willerby Trade Inc.." In July 2013 employees of Tonna created at least three letterbox firms in Panama: "Tillgate Inc." owned by prime minister's chief of staff Keith Schembri, Hearnville Inc. owned by Energy-minister Konrad Mizzi and "Egrant Inc.".
In April 2017 journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia wrote that shares in Egrant Inc. were held by Mossack Fonseca nominees for Michelle Muscat, the wife of Joseph Muscat.
In May 2017, Maltese authorities launched a judicial investigation into payments totalling 100,000 Euros made by Tonna to Schembri at a private bank.
The investigation was launched after Malta's anti-money laundering agency Financial Intelligence and Analysis Unit (FIAU), said in a report that the payments gave rise to "reasonable suspicion of money laundering."
Both Tonna and Schembri have denied any wrongdoing and said the 100,000 Euros were repayment of a personal loan.
In 2019 FIAU was still investigating the case.
In November 2017, PM Muscat came under political pressure from opposition, after details of "17 Black", an obscure company based in Dubai and owned by Yorgen Fenech got puplic.
That company, according to an email from Tonnas "NexiaBT", planned to pay up to 2 million Euros to the Panama-based companies "Tillgate Inc." and "Hearnville Inc." from Mizzi and Schembri.

Wolfgang Friedrich Gess
Wolfgang Friedrich Gess (also spelled Geß) (* 27 July 1819 in Kirchheim unter Teck; † 1 June 1891 in Wernigerode) was a German Lutheran theologian.
Gess was a teacher of theology in Basel from 1850 to 1864.
After that, he became Professor of Systematic Theology in Göttingen, and frpom 1871 in Breslau.
In 1879 he succeeded the deceased General Superintendent in Posen, Friedrich Cranz (1809–1878).
Gess entered upon his duties in April 1880 and as general superintendent of the Old Prussian, he headed the Church province of Posen until 1884.
He was succeeded by Johannes Hesekiel, and settled down in Wernigerode.
The historian Felician Gess (1861–1938) was his son.
Gess is known as the main representative of Kenosis.
His main work was "The Scripture Doctrine of the Person of Christ."
(1878–1887).
Rejecting the Chalcedonian Definition, he sees Christ's incarnation as a transition from the state of being "self-positing" to the state of "being posited".
At conception, Logos was united with the body of Jesus, instead of God creating a human soul, as he does with other men.
The Logos reduced himself to what was compatible with existence as a human soul.
Controversially, Gess thinks that the humanity of Jesus required him to allow his self-consciousness to be extinguished at birth, only to begin to flash through at a certain stage of his physical maturity, and then developing with the goal of sanctification, which is achieved step by step in the choices he freely makes.
Furthermore, Gess argues that a change took place in the Trinity for the duration of the incarnate Logos' earthly life.
The Son no longer proceeds from the Father, and the Spirit proceeds from the Father alone, rather than from the Father and the Son.

1928 United States presidential election in North Dakota
The 1928 United States presidential election in North Dakota took place on November 4, 1924, as part of the 1928 United States presidential election which was held throughout all contemporary 48 states.
Voters chose five representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
North Dakota voted for the Republican nominee, Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, over the Democratic nominee, Governor of New York Al Smith.
Hoover ran with Senate Majority Leader Charles Curtis of Kansas, whilst Smith ran with Senate Minority Leader Joseph T. Robinson of Arkansas.
Although Hoover carried the state, Smith – aided by La Follette’s family’s endorsement of him after La Follette died and North Dakota’s predominantly German Catholic and Lutheran culture – made a massive advance upon James M. Cox’ and John W. Davis’ performances earlier in the decade.
Whereas North Dakota had been Cox’ and Davis’ second-weakest state in 1920 and 1924, it voted 7.07 points more Democratic than the nation at-large in [1928.
In some counties that were largely Lutheran, Smith still made tremendous gains because of his opposition to Prohibition, which was repealed concurrently with this election at a statewide level in North Dakota.
This allowed Smith to be the first Democrat to carry McIntosh County – which had been the nation’s most Republican county in 1920 and where no Democrat had previously gained over 22% of the vote – Logan County, Mercer County, Morton County and Sioux County.

From the mouth of Lake Kénogamichiche, the current follows the course of the Aulnaies river consecutively on towards the northwest, the course of the Belle Rivière on towards the north-west (via a bay), then crosses the eastern part of Lac Saint-Jean towards the north on , follows the course of the Saguenay river via the Petite Décharge on to Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.
This body of water is located in the hollow of a kettle formed following global warming 10,500 years ago, which followed a glaciation whose cover was about three kilometers thick.
Located in the municipality of Hébertville, it is located on the old waterway that once connected the Saguenay to Lake Saint-Jean via Lake Kénogami.
A plateau, where the Beau Portage lake is located, allows communication between these two lakes.
This toponym appears in the form Kinougamichis in the Jesuit Relations of 1672 under the pen of Father Albanel.
This name turns out to be a diminutive of kenogami, meaning "small long lake".
It was once famous for the multitude of long-tailed frogs that inhabited it and made a continuous croaking.
In addition, various spellings have been inventoried for this toponym, including Kinogamichiche, Kinougamisis, Tshnuagamitshish, etc.
The toponym "lac Kénogamichiche" was formalized on September 5, 1968 by the Commission de toponymie du Québec.
Astronomy and spirituality
Astronomy and spirituality have long been intertwined and closely related, mostly after their inception as mainstream subjects.
When man started to take off the planet, psychological and cognitive changes were reported by people who directly interacted with outer space, either in visual manner or in exposure, demonstrated a quality of being furiously motivated and concerned about the Earth.
Joint Forces Maneuver Regiment (Italy)
The Joint Forces Maneuver Regiment () is a military logistics regiment of the Italian Armed Forces based in Rome.
The regiment is operationally assigned to the Defense General Staff and provides the necessary transport for the staff and the Italian Ministry of Defense to operate.
Originally the unit, named 10th Interforces Maneuver Autogroup "Salaria", was part of the Italian Army, but on 1 January 2004 the unit was renamed 10th Transport Battalion "Salaria" and entered the newly raised Joint Forces Maneuver Regiment, which became a joint unit of the Italian Armed Forces, even though the regiment's personnel continues to be drawn from the army's Transport and Material arm.
Like all transport units of the Italian Army the regiment's battalion was named for a historic road near its base: in the 10th battalion's case for the Roman road Via Salaria.
As of 2019 the Joint Forces Maneuver Regiment consists of:
The Command and Logistic Support Company fields the following platoons: C3 Platoon, Transport and Materiel Platoon, Medical Platoon, and Commissariat Platoon.
IBM PS/2 L40SX
The IBM PS/2 L40SX was a portable computer made by IBM, as part of the IBM PS/2 series.
It was the successor to the IBM PC Convertible.
The "SX" in the name refers to its CPU, the Intel 80386SX.
The Wall Street Journal reported that IBM had received 15 complaints of a short circuit occurring between the circuitry and a conductive coating inside the case which, in some instances, has melted a small hole in the case.
The short occurs when the laptop is run on batteries, and IBM reported it will install a fuse to stop overheating.
They had to issue a recall for 150,000 machines.
One year after the announcement of the L40SX, on 24 March 1992, four other notebooks were announced by IBM: N51SX, N51SCL, N45SL and the CL57SX.
The CL57SX was the first laptop from IBM that featured a color TFT display.

Vert Lake (Hébertville)
The Lac Vert is a freswater body of the watershed of Belle Rivière and Lac Saint-Jean, in the municipality of Hébertville, in the Lac-Saint-Jean-Est Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
The area around the lake is served by the route 169 which passes to the west, by the rang Saint-Isidore road (north shore) and by the rang du Lac Vert road (south shore), for the needs of recreational tourism activities, especially vacationing.
Recreational and tourist activities, especially vacationing, are the main economic activities in this area; agriculture and forestry, second.
The surface of Lac Vert is usually frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March, however the safe circulation on the ice is generally done from mid-December to mid-March.
The main watersheds near Lac Vert are:
Lac Vert has a length of , a width of and an altitude of .
This lake is mainly fed by riparian streams.
On the north side, this lake is separated from Kénogamichiche Lake, by a strip of land with a width varying between and , along the entire length of the lake.
The mouth of this lake is located to the northeast, at:
From the mouth of Lac Vert, the current crosses Kénogamichiche Lake on to the west, then follows the course of the Rivière des Aulnaies on north-west, the course of La Belle Rivière on north-west (via a bay), then crosses the eastern part of Lac Saint-Jean toward north on , follows the Saguenay river via the Petite Décharge on to Tadoussac where it merges with the Saint Lawrence estuary.
The toponym "Lac Vert" was formalized on September 23, 1975 by the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

Heather Anderson (politician)
Heather Anderson is a Scottish politician, who briefly served as the Member of the European Parliament for the Scotland constituency in late January 2020.
Anderson was elected as a councillor for the Tweeddale West ward at the 2017 Scottish Borders Council election.
She was originally placed fifth on the Scottish National Party list for the 2019 European Parliament election, where the party won 3 seats.
However, following the election of first placed Alyn Smith at the 2019 United Kingdom general election, he ceased to be an MEP, as an individual cannot simultaneously be a member of a member state's legislature and of the European Parliament.
Fourth placed Margaret Ferrier was also elected at the same election.
This made Anderson eligible for the newly vacant SNP seat, which she took on 27 January 2020.
However, she only served as an MEP for four days until 31 January when the Brexit process completed.
She is an organic farmer who owns her own produce and butcher shop in the Scottish Borders.
Susan G. Bond
Susan Bond (born 1942), was a scientific officer and computer programmer for the Mathematics Division of the Royal Radar Establishment (RRE) in the United Kingdom.
She worked extensively on the ALGOL 68 programming language and the Royal Radar Establishment Automatic Computer (RREAC), an early solid-state, ICL 1907F computer.
Bond was born in 1942 and grew up in Dagenham, Essex, in the UK.
Both her parents were teachers, and she was an only child.
She studied at Bristol University from 1962 to 1965, where she studied mathematics and science and received first-class honours.
After graduating from Bristol, Bond was interested in working in applied mathematics, although she didn't have computer training before that point.
She applied to and joined the Mathematics Division of the RRE in 1965; she was hired by British mathematician and engineer Philip Woodward.
Her work mostly consisted of writing operating systems and compilers, not "numerical" computing.
At the beginning of her career, Bond was the only female scientific officer with a graduate education at RRE.
Bond later learned that her supervisor Woodward had been, as historian Janet Abbate describes, "'actively recruiting women' as an affordable source of high-quality researchers".
One of her first projects was reimplementing Syntax Improving Device (SID), a compiler-compiler tool developed by Michael Foster (another RRE employee) to generate compilers for high-level programming languages.
Afterwards, she worked with Ian Currie on Coral 64, a high-level language for embedded computers.
The RRE had originally used ALGOL 60 for the RREAC from its initial development in 1963.
After the International Federation for Information Processing published the specifications for the more powerful ALGOL 68 in 1968, RRE attempted to adapt it for use on the RREAC.
Susan Bond worked with John Morison and Ian Currie on ALGOL 68-R, the first compiler implementation of ALGOL 68, and they announced its creation at the 20–24 July 1970 conference "IFIP Working Conference on ALGOL 68 Implementation" in Munich.
Their ALGOL 68-R was an adaptation of the ALGOL 60 compiler they had built for RREAC.
The team that worked on ALGOL 68-R intended for the language to become the RRE's primary programming language, which could be used for scientific programming as well as business administration tasks like payroll and taking inventory.
After the publication of the ALGOL 68-R specifications, Bond published a narrative guide to ALGOL 68, titled "ALGOL 68-R User’s Guide", with Philip Woodward through HM Stationery Office.
The guide's initial 17,000 copy run sold out.
Bond effectively provided ongoing support for the compiler; readers would contact her whenever they had trouble implementing it.
Bond and Woodward continued to update and publish new versions of the their guide for the RRE's later implementations of ALGOL, such as ALGOL 68RS.
One reviewer, Richard Shreeve, contested that while their 1983 title "Guide to ALGOL 68 for Users of RS Systems" was an "excellent reference text", it gives "insufficient help to the beginner or newcomer to ALGOL 68".
Bond was promoted to Superintendent of Computing and Software Research of the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment in 1980 (the RRE merged with several other research institutions and was renamed in 1976).
As part of her role, Bond collaborated with the Open Software Foundation on the Architecture Neutral Distribution Format and on computing policy for the UK Ministry of Defense.
Bond retired from work in 1993.
Bond met her husband, Chris Sennett, while working at the RRE.
